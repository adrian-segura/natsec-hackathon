Hicks recounted for the jury how, after the Daniels story became public, Trump told her he was indeed aware of the payments by Michael Cohen to the porn star to keep her quiet. Trump told Hicks that Cohen had made the payments out of loyalty but without his knowledge — a story Hicks did not credit, given what she viewed as Cohen’s desire for credit and his general lack of charitableness (I had <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/watch/-desperate-quest-to-distract-from-trump-house-democrats-call-out-gop-on-classified-documents-206378565576" target="_blank">analogized him earlier in the week</a> to a “dog with a pheasant in his mouth,” who would want to display his offering proudly to his master, with no incentive to keep his good deed to himself).</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">Here was Hicks, taking her oath with solemnity, filling an apparent hole in the DA’s case: that Trump knew about this payoff.</p></div><p class="">Hicks’ testimony thus confirmed that Trump did in fact know of the hush money payments.

That is key, because Trump thereafter reimbursed Cohen for the hush money payments, personally signing the reimbursement checks. Hicks’ testimony makes plain Trump did so knowing that they were not payments for legal fees.\xa0And for that reason, the jury need not decide whether Trump knew of the scheme at the time (as Hicks strongly intimated) or only learned of it later (as he claimed to Hicks), since in either scenario, Trump knew of the scheme prior to making the reimbursements.</p><p class="">Not that corroboration of Hicks’ testimony is needed, but it exists in a particularly damning form: Trump’s own admission in a civil case in California brought by Stormy Daniels. In that lawsuit, Trump admitted he reimbursed Michael Cohen for the $130,000 payment to Daniels.\xa0<a href="https://justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/just-security-clearinghouse-manhattan-trial-joint-opposition-trump-cohen-essential-consultants-to-motion-stephanie-clifford-for-june-1-2018-1.pdf" target="_blank">Trump’s admission</a> — made with his co-defendant, Cohen — is here, and the <a href="https://justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/just-security-clearinghouse-manhattan-trial-clifford-trump-august-17-2020-order-granting-attorney-fees.pdf" target="_blank">California court recognized these statements</a> as admissions. (Trump of course has pleaded not guilty and denied the affairs with McDougal and Daniels.)</p><p class="">One final but important observation of what we are witnessing in this New York courtroom: We are seeing a defendant ably represented. Whatever criticisms there have been of <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-trial-jury-consultants-rcna148637" target="_blank">the caliber of Trump’s legal team</a> in <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/watch/-outrageous-trump-legal-team-presents-ridiculous-presidential-immunity-argument-to-supreme-court-209718853863" target="_blank">other matters</a>, in this case — the most important Trump case to date — there is no question that the defense team is collectively experienced, smart and tenacious.</p><p class="">That is as it should be in our system of laws, but all too often is not for defendants without the power and financial resources of <em>this</em> defendant. These defense counsel are representing a defendant who is deeply unpopular with a vast percentage of the American public. Able representation in such circumstances is as important now as it was when John Adams represented British redcoats charged with murder in our country’s formative years.</p><p class="endmark">How this trial will end — what the jury will find — of course remains to be determined.

He pointed to the fact that some of the people organizing the protests held genuinely odious, fringe views. For instance, the view that North Korea is a worker’s paradise. That’s a bad view. And there were protest organizers with bad views. There were people at the protests who thought 9/11 was an inside job. I would argue with them myself at protests. Did that have anything to do with whether the war in Iraq was moral and prudent? No. It demonstrably wasn’t.

Huge swaths of them were civilians, women, children, male non-combatants, old people.\xa0</p><p class="">Can you even make sense of those numbers? I can’t. It’s hard to think of them, to contend with them, as real human beings who lived lives before we took them. It’s just so much easier to get angry at “spoiled brats” on college campuses here.</p><p class="">Some ask,\xa0<em>Why are they being so disruptive? What are they so upset about?</em>\xa0If you feel that way, I can understand. I’ve felt irritation and anger at protesters many times in my life, even ones I was ostensibly on the same side as broadly speaking. But if you feel that way, try recasting the question: Why are all these people so upset that we are helping another government wage a brutal war that has killed 13,000 children? The question kind of answers itself.\xa0</p><p class="">To take seriously the scale of human suffering that’s happening in Gaza doesn’t mean that you must come down on the side of the protesters. Many people think the war is a brutal but necessary campaign for Israel’s defense. But what it does necessitate is that you weigh all that human suffering against the actual end game of the conflict that is currently being waged — and that the U.S. continues to support. Our humanity demands that we focus on those questions, first and last.</p><p class="endmark"><em>This is an adapted excerpt from\xa0the\xa0</em><a href="https://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/chris-hayes-why-campus-protests-are-the-easier-debate-210090565985" target="_blank"><em>May 1 episode of “All In."</em></a></p></div></div></body></html>'}

And yet, in a motion filed Thursday in Florida, his lawyers <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.648652/gov.uscourts.flsd.648652.508.0_2.pdf" target="_blank">argue that</a> Yick’s case provides a precedent for throwing out the charges in the <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/former-mar-lago-employee-docs-case-isnt-witch-hunt-rcna142924" target="_blank">Mar-a-Lago classified documents prosecution</a>. They say federal prosecutors are engaged in unconstitutional “selective prosecution” of Trump. There are two different, but equally fatal, problems with Trump’s argument. First, for better or worse, the Supreme Court has made selective prosecution claims notoriously difficult to prove. Second, Trump is just about the worst possible person to bring a selective prosecution claim — since so much of his allegedly unlawful conduct in the Mar-a-Lago case is unprecedented.</p><p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"></p><p class="">A claim for selective prosecution is, in essence, a claim that the government chose to prosecute a defendant for the <em>exact same conduct</em> for which it chose not to prosecute a different individual. The claim includes the argument that there was no good reason (and, indeed, a nefarious one, like race or political views) for treating the two cases differently. The argument is <em>not</em> that the defendant is innocent; it’s that the government’s misconduct in singling out the defendant ought to be punished — by barring the prosecution of even a guilty defendant.</p><figure class="styles_inlineImage__yAWZ0 styles_medium__OMa6x styles_portrait__NRWbO"><picture class="styles_image__1qciH" data-testid="picture"><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2023-06/230609-Trump-indictment-photo-5-al-1442-ed79e6.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-06/230609-Trump-indictment-photo-5-al-1442-ed79e6.jpg 1x"></source><source srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2023-06/230609-Trump-indictment-photo-5-al-1442-ed79e6.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-06/230609-Trump-indictment-photo-5-al-1442-ed79e6.jpg 1x"></source><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-06/230609-Trump-indictment-photo-5-al-1442-ed79e6.jpg" alt="This image, contained in the indictment against former President Donald Trump, shows boxes of records on Dec. 7, 2021, in a storage room at Trump\'s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., that had fallen over with contents spilling onto the floor.

Under a series of cases in the late 1990s, for instance, the justices regularly held that to establish a selective prosecution claim, the burden is on the defendant <a href="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep517/usrep517456/usrep517456.pdf" target="_blank">to </a><a href="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep517/usrep517456/usrep517456.pdf" target="_blank"><em>identify</em></a><a href="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep517/usrep517456/usrep517456.pdf" target="_blank"> materially similar cases that the government did not prosecute</a>. And even then the selective prosecution claim would fail if the government had a good reason for not having brought the other case: Say, a suspect in that case cooperated with law enforcement or\xa0there were evidentiary issues.</p><p class="">Only if the defendant could <em>prove</em> that the government had deliberately and intentionally singled him out from <em>other</em> similarly situated suspects without any good reason would such a claim succeed. This is why, for instance, it is exceedingly difficult to prove racial profiling claims. To establish that a police officer only gives speeding tickets to Black motorists, for example, a plaintiff would have to provide evidence of the officer not pulling over other non-Black motorists engaged in the same behavior. The plaintiff would have to prove a negative.</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">It’s the government’s burden to prove those allegations at trial, but in a selective prosecution claim, it’s Trump’s burden to show that similar misconduct by others hasn’t been similarly prosecuted.</p></div><p class="">Applying that high standard to the Mar-a-Lago case is quick work. In the abstract, Trump’s lawyers are absolutely correct that there have been lots of previous cases in which senior government (and former government) officials have mishandled classified national security information and either weren’t charged or were charged with lesser offenses than Trump has been charged with in the Mar-a-Lago indictment. But the Supreme Court requires more than that. Trump would need to produce examples of government officials who, when specifically asked to return classified information wrongfully in their possession, not only lied about having that information but took steps to obstruct the government’s attempt to recover that information. That’s what the indictment in the Mar-a-Lago case alleges Trump <em>did</em>. It’s the government’s burden to prove those allegations at trial, but in a selective prosecution claim, it’s Trump’s burden to show that similar misconduct by others hasn’t been similarly prosecuted.</p><p class="">In this regard, Trump’s uniqueness hurts him, for try as his brief might, it doesn’t identify any other cases with similar claims about affirmative misrepresentations concerning the suspect’s retention of classified information. Because there aren’t any. Indeed, the reason Trump’s selective prosecution claim should <em>fail</em> is because of how much <em>worse</em> the conduct alleged in the Mar-a-Lago case is than that of the other officials his brief invokes as the relevant exemplars. In the court of public opinion, where facts don’t matter all that much, Trump and his supporters can wave their hands and make the cases look similar. But in a court of law, that’s not enough — and shouldn’t be enough.</p><p class="">Like claims about the unfairness of pretrial detention or the severity of the sentences in the Jan. 6 cases, there is a familiar — and perverse — irony at the bottom of Trump’s selective prosecution argument. Maybe we <em>ought</em> to discuss limiting the circumstances, in general, in which pretrial defendants can be detained. Maybe we <em>ought</em> to discuss reforms to <em>all</em> federal criminal sentences. Maybe we <em>ought</em> to discuss making it easier for defendants to establish selective prosecution claims. But as the selective prosecution claim in the Mar-a-Lago case makes clear, Trump isn’t the poster child for these reforms; he’s the anti-poster-child. Indeed, he’s in the position he’s in entirely <em>because</em> his behavior went so far beyond the limits of that of any of his predecessors.</p><p class="endmark">That wasn’t true of Lee Yick, and that why Trump’s arguments that he’s just like Lee Yick are doomed to fail.</p></div></div></body></html>'}
{"Why anti-war protests on college campuses don't compare to 1968's Vietnam War protests", '<html><body><div><div class="article-body__content"><p class="">Perhaps the most challenging thing about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK4lwSsQJsc" target="_blank">having written a book about the 1968 presidential election</a> is that every time there is political violence or <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/pro-palestinian-college-protests-biden-rcna150377" target="_blank">student protests in America</a>, people compare those events to that ill-fated year — and they are pretty much always wrong.</p><p class="">Take, for example, the increasingly omnipresent talk about how the <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/watch/biden-addresses-nationwide-college-campus-protests-210130501810" target="_blank">pro-Palestinian anti-war protests roiling American college campuses</a> today bear similarity to those protests 56 years ago opposing the war in Vietnam. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., even suggested that the war in Gaza “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6rQmvko18M" target="_blank">may be Biden’s Vietnam</a>.”</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">Sen. Bernie Sanders suggested that the war in Gaza “may be Biden’s Vietnam.”</p></div><p class="">These comparisons, like all the others made over the years, are wildly off base. In 1968, there were half a million U.S. troops fighting in Southeast Asia. That year, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_in_the_Vietnam_War" target="_blank">close to 17,000 Americans</a> were killed in Vietnam, and more than 87,000 were wounded. Moreover, there was a national draft scooping up 18-year-olds into the military, and many of those protesting on campuses were taking advantage of college deferments that ensured they wouldn’t be forced to join the army.</p><p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"></p><p class="">Today, not only does America have an all-volunteer army, but no U.S. troops are fighting in Gaza — or are at any serious risk of being deployed there. College students might be enraged about the situation in Gaza, but unlike their generational predecessors who had to worry about being sent into conflict, virtually none of them has that kind of skin in the game.</p><p class="">But the false comparisons to 1968 don’t end there. More than a half-century ago, Vietnam was one of the pre-eminent issues on the minds of American voters. Outrage and frustration over the conduct of the war spurred Sen. Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy of New York to launch primary challenges against incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson. After an underwhelming performance in the New Hampshire primary and Kennedy’s entry into the race soon after, Johnson shocked the nation by bowing out and ending his bid for re-election. Throughout the summer and fall of 1968, eventual Democratic nominee Vice President Hubert Humphrey, was hounded on the campaign trail by anti-war protesters.</p><p class="">Not only is the war in Gaza not a primary issue of concern for voters; it doesn’t even crack the top 10. Indeed, according to the <a href="https://iop.harvard.edu/youth-poll/47th-edition-spring-2024" target="_blank">recent Harvard poll of voters aged 18-29</a>, Israel/Palestine ranked 15th out of 16 on their list of the most important issues facing America. \xa0 (Oddly the only issue that ranked lower was student debt.)\xa0 Remember, this is the group of Americans that is supposedly the most concerned about the situation in the Middle East. However, even among Democratic voters 18-29, Gaza ranks 13th — far behind abortion, gun violence, health care and protecting democracy. In fact, only <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/04/30/israel-palestine-protests-biden-college-young-voters?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiossneakpeek&amp;stream=top" target="_blank">2% of young voters</a> consider the war in Gaza their top concern.</p><p class="">It’s also far from clear that young people are disproportionately partial to the Palestinian cause.\xa0A nearly equal percentage of young people sympathize with the Israeli and Palestinian people — while holding\xa0 far more negative views of their leaders.</p><p class="">But perhaps most telling is that close to 45% of those polled say they don’t know enough about the situation in Gaza to form an opinion. It’s very difficult to imagine a similar poll result in 1968 about the Vietnam War.</p><p class="">For all the coverage that campus protests are receiving, the reality is that we’re talking about a tiny number of students on a tiny number of elite university campuses and on an issue that the vast majority of young voters either don’t care about or don’t understand.</p><p class="">Ironically, this is one place where the situation in 1968 is similar to today — though not in the way that most people would assume.</p><p class="">History has lionized anti-war protesters as the voice of a generation — and while those protesters were right about the wrongness of the war in Vietnam, they did not speak for their generation.</p><p class="">Indeed, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/American-Maelstrom-Election-Politics-Division/dp/019977756X" target="_blank">the demographic group most supportive of the war in Vietnam</a> were those aged 18-29 (the group most opposed were those who came of age during WWI and WWII). In addition, anti-war protesters were among the most unpopular group of Americans in the country — even among those opposed to the war in Vietnam.</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">According to a recent Morning Consult poll, a plurality of Americans would like to see colleges ban both pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian demonstrations.</p></div><p class="">Back then, Americans disliked the chaos and disorder that came from anti-war protests — and here again, not much has changed.</p><p class="">According to a recent Morning Consult poll, a plurality of Americans would like to <a href="https://twitter.com/jimcmann/status/1786018438151844214/photo/1" target="_blank">see colleges ban</a> both pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian demonstrations.

Unlike Johnson and later Humphrey, there’s very little indication that President Joe Biden is paying much of a political price for the war in Gaza.</p><p class="">Even though Biden <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-says-netanyahu-making-mistake-handling-israel-hamas-war-rcna147092" target="_blank">has publicly criticized the Israeli government</a>, pressured Israel not to launch a military offensive in the Hamas-held city of Rafah and even sanctioned Israeli military units, he has been vilified by pro-Palestinian activists as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/14/genocide-israel-gaza-iran-trump-biden/" target="_blank">“Genocide Joe.”</a></p><p class="">As a result, it’s become practically pro forma among media commentators to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/inside-democratic-rebellion-against-biden-over-gaza-war-2024-02-27/" target="_blank">suggest that Biden’s perceived support for Israel is a political liability</a>.</p><p class="">But, again, the data doesn’t support this view. As CNN’s polling guru Harry Enten recently pointed out, <a href="https://twitter.com/ForecasterEnten/status/1783141483119333574" target="_blank">Biden’s declining support</a> among young voters predates the war in Gaza — and the war has had practically no effect on 2024 presidential polling. Even though Biden’s favorability rating is at a measly 31% among young voters, he is still leading Trump by 19 points with this cohort.\xa0Considering Biden’s terrible numbers among young people, one would expect him to be doing even worse.</p><p class="">Granted, that’s worse than his <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-elections/exit-polls/?icid=election_nav" target="_blank">approximate 25-point margin in 2020 with those aged 18-29</a>, but we are also six\xa0months away from Election Day. In other words, there’s plenty of time for Biden to convince younger voters that whatever their problems with him — the alternative is far worse.</p><p class="">Of course, a lot can happen between now and Election Day. <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-michigan-primary-uncommitted-votes-rcna128030" target="_blank">Perhaps Biden will pay a price with Arab voters in the crucial swing state of Michigan</a>. It’s quite possible that Chicago, the site of this year’s Democratic convention (like the one in 1968), will be witness to protests and even violence (also like the one in 1968).\xa0But based on what we know now, the likely political fallout from the war in Gaza looks nothing like what the country experienced\xa0 56 years ago over the war in Vietnam.</p><p class="endmark">Not that these obvious distinctions will stop people from making the comparisons.</p></div></div></body></html>', 'https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/campus-protests-vietnam-1968-rcna150587'}

None of these restrictions will apply to for-profit bail bond agents, who charge a 10% premium for their services, and who rarely face the same levels of scrutiny that bail funds do. Without charitable bail funds, more poor Georgians will be forced into often-predatory contracts with bail bond agents to get their loved ones out of jail.</p><p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"></p><p class="">Charitable bail funds across the country have found themselves caught in conservatives’ crosshairs. Last year, after people protested for months against the construction of a $109 million police training facility in Atlanta, law enforcement agents arrested nonprofit workers with <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/stop-cop-city-bail-fund-arrests-rcna87357" target="_blank">the Atlanta Solidarity Fund</a>. That charitable bail fund had been providing bail assistance to those who’d been arrested while protesting. The arrests were deemed by some as an <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/06/cop-city-tortuguita-atlanta-bail-fund-arrest-horror.html" target="_blank">excessive</a> <a href="https://bailproject.org/press/atlanta-solidarity-fund-raid-concerns/" target="_blank">display</a> of force.</p><p class="">Charitable bail funds are being increasingly targeted, despite their humanitarian missions and despite the <a href="https://bailproject.org/learn/a-brief-history-of-bail-funds-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank">historic role</a> such organizations have had in human and civil rights movements since the 1920s.</p><p class="">Georgia’s new law will have disastrous consequences for some of the most vulnerable people in the state, protesters or otherwise. Parents will lose custody of their children. People will be evicted from their homes and fired from their jobs. Those struggling with their health — physical and mental — will decline. People of color and individuals living in poverty will be <a href="https://apnews.com/article/illinois-criminal-justice-cash-bail-reform-b8aac667b7d3016e12ea64a70964bf55#:~:text=A%202022%20federal%20civil%20rights,19%25%20higher%20than%20white%20men." target="_blank">most affected</a>. The effects of pretrial incarceration will destabilize individuals and families for years to come.</p><p class=""><a href="https://bailproject.org/" target="_blank">The Bail Project</a> launched in 2018, and since then we’ve provided free bail assistance and voluntary supportive services to more than 30,000 low-income Americans. Our clients have returned to 91% of their court dates, a statistic that lays waste to the argument that cash bail is necessary to incentivize a person’s return to court. Take our client, <a href="https://bailproject.org/stories/what-happens-to-your-pet-when-youre-arrested/" target="_blank">Sherry Baird</a>, an Atlanta-based 61-year-old. She was arrested and incarcerated pretrial for nearly a month because she couldn’t afford $11,200 in bail. It’s been two years, and she has not been indicted for a crime. Had The Bail Project not intervened, she would likely still be behind bars today, having not been convicted of anything.</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">Georgia’s new law will have disastrous consequences for some of the most vulnerable people in the state, protesters or otherwise. </p></div><p class="">Baird’s situation is not a one-off. Georgia jails are in crisis —\xa0buckling under long case-processing delays, overcrowding and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/man-died-severe-neglect-fulton-county-jail-bed-bug-infestation-autopsy-rcna85676" target="_blank">inhumane conditions</a>. Amid this crisis, we’ve supported nearly 1,500 legally innocent Georgians, the majority of whose cases have still not reached trial, been dismissed, or had a plea deal accepted after two years. Some have cases that have gone on for more than 900 days without resolution — which is two to four times longer than cases in other states where we operate. Without our help, many of our clients would have been exposed to the incredible harms of unnecessary incarceration because of these case delays; others would have succumbed to the <a href="https://www.nacdl.org/Landing/TheTrialPenalty#:~:text=The%20\'trial%20penalty\'%20is%20the,constitutional%20right%20to%20a%20trial." target="_blank">tremendous pressure</a> to accept plea deals even when they’re innocent, forfeiting their right to a trial just to get out of jail.</p><p class="">Bail is an important, yet highly misunderstood, aspect of our pretrial system. One common misconception is that bail is designed to keep people locked up before trial, but that’s wrong. Bail was designed as a mechanism of release. When cash bail is misused to detain people, it distorts the judicial process by letting people with money out of jail and keeping in jail people who don’t have money. Public safety, not wealth, should determine who is detained pretrial.</p><p class="">In recent years, at least a dozen jurisdictions have minimized or eliminated the use of bail in some capacity. Illinois has totally eliminated it.\xa0Across these jurisdictions, there has been no <a href="https://www.hfg.org/hfg_reports/bail-reform-2023/" target="_blank">statistically significant</a> increase in rates of pretrial rearrest or nonappearance. In fact, in some counties, reducing bail actually improves community safety. In <a href="https://bailproject.org/learn/five-questions-about-texas-bail-reform/" target="_blank">Harris County</a>, Texas — home to Houston —\xa0for instance, the volume of people being arrested and rearrested declined over time and the misdemeanor system as a whole has shrunk. The overall effect is likely because needlessly incarcerating people pretrial only destabilizes them. In other words, the supposed treatment — incarceration — is actually harmful.</p><p class="">Research shows that a stay in <a href="https://squareonejustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/CJLJ8161-Square-One-Presumption-of-Innocence-Paper-200519-WEB.pdf" target="_blank">jail as short as 48 hours</a> increases the likelihood of a person being incarcerated again in the future because of the attendant job loss, residential instability, financial insecurity and exacerbation of physical and mental health that results from incarceration. In the field of medicine, this type of result would cause doctors to immediately reverse course.\xa0This is strong evidence that our courts and communities can safely function without the harmful practice of setting cash bail.</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">Even against this backdrop of successful reform, efforts to usher in a fairer and more equitable pretrial system still face considerable pushback.</p></div><p class="">But even\xa0against this backdrop of successful reform, efforts to usher in a fairer and more equitable pretrial system still face considerable pushback. Lawmakers in at least 14 states — including Indiana, Missouri and Wisconsin — introduced about 20 bills in 2023 to increase the use of cash bail. Just last month, Kentucky lawmakers voted to <a href="https://bailproject.org/press/with-dangerous-veto-override-kentucky-lawmakers-turn-misguided-safer-kentucky-act-into-law/" target="_blank">override Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto of HB 5</a>, a law criminalizing poverty and homelessness by increasing penalties for sleeping on the street if you’re homeless and for possessing certain narcotics. Decisions by these legislatures serve to only prop up the two-tiered system of justice created by cash bail, where if you’re rich you’re released pretrial, but if you’re poor, it’s a different story.</p><p class="">Charitable bail funds, much like food pantries, pool resources to support the most vulnerable, thereby closing the gap between insufficient service provision by government and the unmet needs of our friends and neighbors. In many ways, charitable bail funds help show what our pretrial system should and could be.</p><p class="endmark">However, The Bail Project is one of several charitable bail organizations that will be prevented from supporting vulnerable Georgians because of this new law. Given how<a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/brief/georgia-courts-still-struggle-with-pandemic-era-backlogs-state-supreme-court-chief-justice-says/" target="_blank"> case delays</a> plague the state’s criminal justice system, this law will only further congest Georgia’s<a href="https://www.thecentersquare.com/georgia/article_eaf6c26c-7a75-11ee-86f3-a3fb9887de6a.html" target="_blank"> overcrowded</a> and<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/11/12/1212534845/10-inmates-have-died-in-the-overcrowded-fulton-county-jail-in-atlanta" target="_blank"> deadly</a> jails, subjecting countless numbers to needless suffering. Instead of advancing smart policies that reduce the grip of wealth in our pretrial system, lawmakers in Georgia have chosen to turn their backs to evidence, opting to politicize the issue of cash bail and strike a blow against protests for shortsighted political gain.</p></div></div></body></html>', "Georgia's new ban on charitable bail funds is cruelty at its finest", 'https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/georgia-cash-bail-fund-law-brian-kemp-rcna150440'}

The final tally —\xa0320-91 — masks how controversial the legislation is or that some Democratic lawmakers voted for it while effectively under duress.

Since then, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, the Israeli invasion and bombardment of Gaza have killed <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-iran-hamas-latest-04-29-2024-28196afeb6e34c3a287770f71187cc4e" target="_blank">an estimated 34,000 Palestinians</a>. The massive number of civilian casualties has sparked protests across the U.S., leading to the recent pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses and the bill’s sudden reappearance on the House calendar.</p><p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"></p><p class="">At first glance, the bill doesn’t do much that would seem objectionable. Its main function is to alter how the Department of Education assesses whether an incident violates <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2008-title42/html/USCODE-2008-title42-chap21-subchapV.htm" target="_blank">Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>. That section mandates that if an institution receives federal funding, it can’t exclude or discriminate against people based on, among other things, race, national origin and religion. Should the Antisemitism Awareness Act become law, the department would be required to “take into consideration” a “working definition” of antisemitism that the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, an intergovernmental group that includes the United States, drafted in 2016.</p><p class="">The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180825032144/https:/www.holocaustremembrance.com/sites/default/files/press_release_document_antisemitism.pdf" target="_blank">“working definition” itself</a> is expressed in two legally nonbinding sentences: “Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.”\xa0Taken alone, that’s a relatively anodyne definition, one that the U.S. State Department has adopted and was cited positively in the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/U.S.-National-Strategy-to-Counter-Antisemitism.pdf" target="_blank">National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism</a>, which the Biden administration issued last year.</p><p class="">But the IHRA also included illustrative examples along with the definition when distributing it, and that’s where <a href="https://www.eccpalestine.org/the-ihra-working-definition-of-antisemitism-fact-sheet-and-recommendations-issued-by-eccp-and-free-speech-on-israel/" target="_blank">things get dicey</a>. “Manifestations might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity,” the IHRA’s press release read. “However, criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic.” It then went on to list a set of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180825032144/https:/www.holocaustremembrance.com/sites/default/files/press_release_document_antisemitism.pdf" target="_blank">“contemporary examples of antisemitism,”</a> which include several other Israel-specific examples, including “denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor,” “applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation,” “drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.”</p><p class="">There’s been some debate over <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/labour-should-ditch-ihra-working-definition-of-antisemitism-altogether/" target="_blank">whether those examples</a> should be considered part of the working definition. <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/23/ihra-misrepresents-own-definition-of-anti-semitism-says-report" target="_blank">Al Jazeera reported in 2021</a> that the IRHA plenary that adopted it apparently only approved the two-sentence version due to concerns from some attending governments about the broad sweep of the examples. But the bill the House approved on Wednesday circumvented that issue by specifically including the “contemporary examples” as part of the definition the Education Department would need to reference.</p><p class="">It’s telling the GOP leadership brought this bill up for a vote when <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/bipartisan-lawmakers-bill-targeting-antisemitism-israel-hamas-gaza-rcna146674" target="_blank">another, more comprehensive bipartisan bill</a> was waiting in the wings. The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7921/text" target="_blank">Countering Antisemitism Act</a>, which was introduced earlier this month, would among other things establish a “national coordinator to counter antisemitism” in the White House to implement the strategy released last year. It would also require federal agencies to report to Congress annually on the steps they’ve taken to put the strategy into practice. It’s not a perfect bill, but unlike the bill voted on Friday it recognizes that a definition of antisemitism is <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:36%20section:2301%20edition:prelim)" target="_blank">already in place in federal law</a> and only cites the IHRA definition as a “valuable tool to raise awareness and increase understanding of antisemitism.”</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">It’s telling that this bill is the one that came up for a vote when another, more comprehensive bipartisan bill was waiting in the wings.</p></div><p class="">Contrary to some of the concerns I’ve seen circulating out there, the Antisemitism Awareness Act wouldn’t make the kinds of critical statements listed in the IHRA’s examples outright illegal for the vast majority of Americans. But it would likely have a chilling effect in classrooms and on college campuses. There likely would be an even higher surge in conflation between antisemitism, which targets Jews for who they are, and criticism of Israeli politics and policies than we’ve already seen. That was the main point the American Civil Liberties Union <a href="https://www.aclu.org/documents/aclu-urges-congress-to-oppose-anti-semitism-awareness-act" target="_blank">made in a letter to lawmakers</a> last week encouraging them to vote against the bill.</p><p class="">Their pleas clearly went unheeded given the wide margin by which the bill passed, though with some <a href="https://punchbowl.news/archive/5224-punchbowl-news-am/" target="_blank">grumbling behind the scenes</a> even from Democrats who wound up voting for it. “It’s so dumb. ... I think we want to send a message about antisemitism, but we should do it in a way that’s more united,” Rep. Scott Peters, D-Calif., <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/05/01/antisemitism-bill-mike-johnson-democrats-mtg" target="_blank">told Axios</a>. But there were still dissenting voices — some with better points than others.</p><p class="">“Speech that is critical of Israel — alone — does not constitute unlawful discrimination,” Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., a prominent Jewish member of the House, <a href="https://nadler.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=395152" target="_blank">said in a floor speech ahead of the vote</a>. “By encompassing purely political speech about Israel into Title VI’s ambit, the bill sweeps too broadly.” In contrast, GOP Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Matt Gaetz of Florida voted against it because they worried that it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/us/politics/antisemitism-jews-republicans-democrats-congress.html" target="_blank">would do too good a job</a> of preventing people from pushing the antisemitic claim that the Jews, and not the Romans, killed Jesus.</p><p class="endmark">It seems unlikely that this bill will become law because it’s unlikely the Senate will pass it. That raises the question of why even go through with this pantomime in the first place for a bill that <a href="https://raskin.house.gov/2024/5/rep-raskin-statement-on-h-r-6090" target="_blank">Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md.</a>, said is vague enough to be either pointless or an unconstitutional infringement on the First Amendment. It’s an accurate assessment of the bill’s flaws —\xa0which makes it all the more concerning that he and 132 of his Democratic colleagues still voted for a measure that is still, in fact, harmful in its construction.</p></div></div></body></html>'}

{"Hope Hicks caps another dramatic week in Trump's hush money trial", '<html><body><div><div class="showblog-body__content"><p class="">Welcome back, Deadline: Legal Newsletter readers. It was a historic week in the first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president, with Donald Trump being held in criminal contempt. Judge Juan Merchan hasn’t jailed him yet over his repeated gag order violations<strong> </strong>— <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-trial-gag-order-judge-merchan-prosecutors-rcna150401" target="_blank">and prosecutors haven’t asked him to yet</a> — but the threat of incarceration looms as we enter the third week of testimony.</p><p class=""><strong>This second week made progress</strong> on the state’s election-interference theory. Two of the biggest witnesses this week were former Trump aide <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/jose-diaz-balart/watch/former-trump-aide-hope-hicks-testifies-in-hush-money-trial-210205765828" target="_blank">Hope Hicks</a> and <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/chris-jansing-reports/watch/trump-lawyer-questions-keith-davidson-on-involvement-in-stories-about-sex-tapes-210135621888" target="_blank">Keith Davidson</a>, a lawyer who represented alleged hush money recipients Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels. Both Davidson and Hicks testified to, among other things, the impact of <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-trial-access-hollywood-tape-rcna150210" target="_blank">the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape</a>, which is taking on its own starring role in the prosecution even if the recording itself doesn’t come into evidence.</p><div class="pullquote pullquote--small" data-testid="pullquote-small"><p class="pullquote__quote" data-testid="pullquote-quote">“It wasn’t until ‘Access Hollywood’ that interest sort of reached a crescendo."</p><p class="pullquote__attribution"><cite class="pullquote__cite" data-testid="pullquote-attribution">— trial witness keith davidson</cite><span class="pullquote__quip" data-testid="pullquote-quip"></span></p></div><p class=""><strong>A “damaging development” </strong>is how Hicks described the tape that was released just ahead of the 2016 election. The recording showed Trump a decade earlier bragging about being able to grab women by their genitals. “It wasn’t until ‘Access Hollywood’ that interest sort of reached a crescendo,” Davidson testified, explaining how the deal went down to secure Daniels’ silence as Trump successfully sought the White House. Expect to keep hearing about the tape as the case goes on.</p><p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"></p><p class=""><strong>Trump also broke new ground this week</strong> by earning the criminal contempt finding from Merchan. The judge said in a ruling Tuesday that Trump <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/judge-merchan-trump-gag-order-ruling-rcna148937" target="_blank">violated the gag order nine times</a>. Merchan imposed the maximum fines available of $9,000 total and warned the defendant that jail may be next. The judge held yet another hearing over more possible violations Thursday, but prosecutors still didn’t press for jail <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-trial-gag-order-judge-merchan-prosecutors-rcna150401" target="_blank">“yet,”</a> they said, to avoid disrupting the proceeding.</p><p class=""><strong>One wonders how much longer</strong> they — and ultimately, Merchan — can delay the seeming inevitable incarceration of a defendant who prosecutors allege keeps violating the court order.</p><p class=""><strong>The Supreme Court is done with oral arguments</strong> after last week’s immunity hearing in Trump’s case. But the justices <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/042924zor_ihdj.pdf" target="_blank">issued orders</a> in pending appeals, blocking former Trump White House adviser <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/peter-navarro-prison-release-supreme-court-rcna149766" target="_blank">Peter Navarro’s bid to get out of jail</a>, turning away <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-rejects-elon-musk-agreement-sec-vet-social-media-posts-rcna149579" target="_blank">Elon Musk’s appeal</a> against the SEC, and <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2024/04/court-allows-texas-to-enforce-age-verification-for-online-porn-sites/" target="_blank">declining a free speech challenge</a> to a Texas law requiring age verification for pornography sites, which <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-declines-block-texas-pornography-restriction-rcna149877" target="_blank">makes adults submit personal information</a>.</p><p class=""><strong>The justices are set to issue opinions</strong> this coming week, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/" target="_blank">on Thursday</a>.

Is there anything that constrains them to confine themselves to the question before them? If they cannot do that in this case, we stand to lose our right to hear Trump’s other trials before the 2024 election</em></strong><strong>.”</strong></p><p class="">— Lori G., Kansas City, Missouri</p><p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"></p><p class="">Hi Lori,</p><p class="">The only thing constraining the Supreme Court is the late Justice <a href="https://www.oyez.org/justices/william_j_brennan_jr" target="_blank">William Brennan</a>’s “rule of five.” With five votes, the liberal justice <a href="https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1825&amp;context=facpub" target="_blank">said</a>, you could accomplish anything. And with six “conservative” justices on today’s court, they can afford to lose one of their own and still form a <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf" target="_blank">right-wing majority</a>. This imbalance is a good advertisement for <a href="https://time.com/6127193/supreme-court-reform-expansion/" target="_blank">court packing</a> but, getting back to your inquiry, I don’t think that straying from the question presented is the biggest problem in Trump v. United States. Rather, the issue is the delay that the court’s handling of the case has already given the defendant.</p><p class="">First off, we should remember that <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/022824zr3_febh.pdf" target="_blank">the question presented</a> is: “Whether and if so to what extent does a former President enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office.” That’s a fairly broad subject, not confined to Trump’s case alone. And that breadth isn’t unusual. The court is theoretically concerned with the implications of the rule that it fashions going forward, as opposed to the particulars of the case before it. That’s how Republican-appointed justices likely soothed themselves in <a href="https://ballsandstrikes.org/law-politics/supreme-court-january-6-erasure/" target="_blank">dodging discussion</a> of the allegations against their party’s de-facto leader (who has pleaded not guilty in all four of his criminal cases). Instead, they focused on loftier notions. As Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2023/23-939_f2qg.pdf" target="_blank">said</a> at the hearing, they are writing a rule “for the ages.”</p><p class="">Of course, the court doesn’t always do that. Recall <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZPC.html" target="_blank">Bush v. Gore</a>, which tipped the 2000 election to the Republican. The court stressed there: “Our consideration is limited to the present circumstances, for the problem of equal protection in election processes generally presents many complexities.” The April 25 hearing in Trump’s case showed that today’s justices (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/amy-coney-barrett-bush-gore/2020/10/10/594641b8-09e3-11eb-991c-be6ead8c4018_story.html" target="_blank">some of whom worked as lawyers on the Bush side</a> of that 2000 case) think that presidential immunity likewise “presents many complexities.” But here we are, on the precipice of a soaring ruling for the history books (one that may, once again, just so happen to <a href="https://www.heritage.org/conservatism/commentary/project-2025" target="_blank">benefit Republicans</a>).</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">The justices can’t ignore the impact that their choices had in delaying this case from going to trial.</p></div><p class="">Whatever judicial philosophy the court claims to follow in Trump v. United States, the justices can’t ignore the impact that their choices had in delaying this case from going to trial. Those choices include <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-immunity-supreme-court-election-case-rcna130670" target="_blank">declining in December</a> to take up the immunity issue early on at the government’s request; <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-supreme-court-immunity-review-rcna139183" target="_blank">granting Trump’s appeal in February</a> instead of letting the case go to trial in March (it could have already been tried by now); setting a <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-trump-immunity-date-last-case-rcna142211" target="_blank">leisurely late-April hearing</a> (the appeal could have already been decided as well); and now, embarking on crafting an immaculate decision “for the ages,” while the clock ticks toward an election whose outcome could lead to Trump crushing this very case if he returns to the White House.</p><p class="">The problem, then, is the court treating this case in some respects like a normal one while, at best, ignoring the reality lurking within. Regardless of whether we have a “right,” as you put it, to Trump’s trials before the election — and I’m not so sure we do, for reasons I can explain another time — the Supreme Court’s actions have made such a trial in his Jan. 6 case increasingly less likely. \xa0\xa0</p><p class="endmark"><strong>Have any questions or comments for me?

New York state prosecutors <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-trial-access-hollywood-tape-rcna150210" target="_blank">built their case</a>, and the judge fined the defendant for <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-trial-gag-order-judge-merchan-prosecutors-rcna150401" target="_blank">violating a court order nine times</a>. Here are five top takeaways from the second week of testimony in People v. Donald Trump:</p><h2 class="">1.<strong> Presumptive nominee held in criminal contempt</strong></h2><p class="">One of the biggest takeaways this week was something that happened without a witness on the stand. Judge Juan Merchan <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/judge-merchan-trump-gag-order-ruling-rcna148937" target="_blank">ruled Tuesday</a> that the former president violated a gag order <em>nine times</em>. Merchan only imposed fines rather than jail, but the judge <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/full-text-trump-gag-order-ruling-pdf-rcna150005" target="_blank">threatened the latter punishment</a> for future violations. The judge also held yet another hearing <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-trial-gag-order-hearing-merchan-rcna150292" target="_blank">Thursday on potential additional violations</a>. No matter the outcome of this trial, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee serially skirting a court order in his case merits emphasis.</p><h2 class=""><strong>2. Prosecutors build their case</strong></h2><p class="">In his opening statement <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-hush-money-trial-witness-testimony-takeaways-rcna149542" target="_blank">last week</a>, prosecutor Matthew Colangelo<strong> </strong>told the jury that the case is about Trump trying to corrupt the 2016 presidential election and then covering it up by lying in his New York business records “over and over and over again.” Among the witnesses the state used to build on that theory this week were <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-trial-evidence-witness-credibility-rcna150073" target="_blank">Keith Davidson</a>, a lawyer who represented alleged hush-money recipients Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels, and former Trump aide <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/live-blog/trump-hush-money-trial-day-11-live-updates-rcna149908" target="_blank">Hope Hicks</a>. Davidson’s testimony gave an inside look at how the purported payoff scheme came together ahead of the election, while Hicks’ gave jurors an inside view from the Trump camp. (Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied having sex with the former Playboy model McDougal and adult film actress Daniels.)</p><h2 class=""><strong>3. The ‘Access Hollywood’ tape is crucial</strong></h2><p class="">The infamous tape released a month ahead of the 2016 election continues to dominate throughout the trial. Both Davidson and Hicks testified to the impact of the recording that contained Trump bragging about being able to grab women by their genitals. “It wasn’t until ‘Access Hollywood’ that interest sort of reached a crescendo,”\xa0<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/live-blog/trump-trial-hush-money-case-live-updates-rcna149906/rcrd40380?canonicalCard=true" target="_blank">Davidson testified Tuesday</a>, explaining how the deal went down to secure Daniels’ silence as Trump successfully sought the White House. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/live-blog/trump-hush-money-trial-day-11-live-updates-rcna149908#rcrd40784" target="_blank">Hicks said Friday</a> that it was a “damaging development” for the campaign.</p><h2 class=""><strong>4. Not every witness is ‘big,’ but they matter</strong></h2><p class="">Most people following the case are familiar with Hicks and, perhaps to a lesser extent, Davidson. But jurors also heard from lower-profile witnesses who are nonetheless important to proving the state’s case. For example, the jury has now heard from <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/gary-farro-testimony-trump-hush-money-trial-rcna149837" target="_blank">Gary Farro</a>, the banker Cohen dealt with to carry out the alleged hush money payoff. Prosecutors also called more technical witnesses to the stand, such as a forensic analyst to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/live-blog/trump-hush-money-trial-day-11-live-updates-rcna149908#rcrd40743" target="_blank">bring out evidence from Michael Cohen’s phones</a>.</p><h2 class=""><strong>5. Introducing Michael Cohen</strong></h2><p class="">Cohen himself still hasn’t testified, but he <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-trial-michael-cohen-witness-credibility-rcna150237" target="_blank">certainly has come up</a> — and not in a flattering way. The lawyer Davidson and the banker Farro both made clear how Cohen was difficult to deal with and even deceptive. At first glance, one might think prosecutors wouldn’t like that unceremonious airing of a potentially important witness yet to come. But it may benefit them because when Cohen takes the stand, his unscrupulous character won’t be a revelation to the jury. Indeed, Manhattan jurors may feel like they already know him by then.</p><p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"></p><p class="endmark"><strong>Subscribe to the\xa0</strong><a href="https://link.msnbc.com/join/5ck/msnbc-deadlinelegal-signup-inline" target="_blank"><strong>Deadline: Legal\xa0Newsletter</strong></a><strong>\xa0for weekly updates on the top legal stories, including news from the Supreme Court, the Donald Trump cases and more.</strong></p></div></div></body></html>'}

While their policy wins have been modest, they illustrate how in a very brief period of time students were able to use pressure to extract policy wins from their universities.\xa0\xa0\xa0</p><figure class="styles_inlineImage__yAWZ0 styles_medium__OMa6x"><picture class="styles_image__1qciH" data-testid="picture"><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2024-05/240502-ucla-mb-1331-aed060.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-05/240502-ucla-mb-1331-aed060.jpg 1x"></source><source srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2024-05/240502-ucla-mb-1331-aed060.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-05/240502-ucla-mb-1331-aed060.jpg 1x"></source><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-05/240502-ucla-mb-1331-aed060.jpg" alt="Demonstrators arrested on UCLA campus in the early hours of Thursday morning."></picture><figcaption class="caption styles_caption__Pe5JC" data-testid="caption"><span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container">Demonstrators are detained on the UCLA campus on May 2, 2024, in Los Angeles.</span><span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source">Ryan Sun / AP</span></figcaption></figure><p class="">The protests that we’ve seen aggressively quashed have also been successful, but in a different way. Protesters who provoked crackdowns generated an extraordinary amount of attention for their cause by putting their bodies, and in some cases their careers, on the line in order to object to Israel’s U.S.-backed brutalization of Gazans. Israel’s operation in Gaza in response to Hamas’ Oct. 7 terror attacks has been going on for some seven months, and reports of mass civilian death in Gaza have become routinized. The encampments and campus protests which elicited fierce pushback helped ensure that America did not become numb to the rising body count, and made it clear to Democrats that activists are not backing down from trying to make this a top tier issue as Election Day approaches.\xa0</p><p class="">These kinds of protests do not necessarily have to garner widespread public support to be effective. Using encampments and occupations to lobby for a political cause is part of a long tradition of student protest — Columbia University protesters<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/columbia-university-gaza-solidarity-encampment-cuad-palestine-protest/" target="_blank">specifically cited</a> the precedent and tactics of anti-South African apartheid and anti-Vietnam War activists at their own university as they set up their encampment. The friction that the protests have produced with universities has in turn invited national debate, and encouraged a wave of solidarity that has spread across the country and the world. Historically, these kinds of protests are often not widely popular in the short term, and indeed a recent YouGov poll indicates that a plurality of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/03/college-protests-polling/" target="_blank">Americans view them negatively</a>. But the poll also shows that more Democrats and young people support them than not. And that’s critical, because one of the key points of leverage the movement has is threatening to discourage progressive Democrats and young people from voting for the president unless he makes major policy changes. </p><p class="">To be clear, the conversations sparked by the protests weren’t always good ones. The protests themselves were not without problems — there have been <a href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2024/04/encampment-100-hours-photo-essay" target="_blank">some</a> <a href="https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/article-798160" target="_blank">reports</a> of antisemitic language or advocacy for attacking Israeli civilians at the protests, which are reprehensible, should not be tolerated and do nothing but damage the cause of Palestinian freedom. But the bulk of protesters have been motivated by horror over the treatment of people in Gaza, not by bigotry. Another issue is that a lot of national media focused on the drama surrounding the protests to the point that they obscured the core issue that animated them in the first place: what’s happening in Gaza. (My colleague Chris Hayes laid out how the media lost perspective <a href="https://twitter.com/allinwithchris/status/1785836176449970491" target="_blank">in an excellent segment on his show</a>.)</p><figure class="styles_inlineImage__yAWZ0 styles_medium__OMa6x"><picture class="styles_image__1qciH" data-testid="picture"><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2024-05/240502-ucla-protest-mb-1207-7578a3.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-05/240502-ucla-protest-mb-1207-7578a3.jpg 1x"></source><source srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2024-05/240502-ucla-protest-mb-1207-7578a3.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-05/240502-ucla-protest-mb-1207-7578a3.jpg 1x"></source><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-05/240502-ucla-protest-mb-1207-7578a3.jpg" alt="Police deployed a heavy presence on US university campuses on May 1 after forcibly clearing away some weeks-long protests against Israel\'s war with Hamas.

The student protesters have shown resolve, creativity and ambition. And political organizing often begets more sophisticated political organizing — the networks, knowledge and grit that activists develop in one set of protests can often help lay the foundation for additional, more well-organized rounds of them.</p><p class="">There’s good reason to think the action will continue.

Barring a permanent cease-fire, it seems more likely than ever that some version of this scene might unfold again. Such a confrontation could be a significant political liability for Biden; the president could look both callous and ineffectual at the same time. At a critical political moment he would represent the face behind brutal police crackdowns, appear to be a poor and cruel policymaker unable to do what\'s right in the Middle East, and look unable to manage his own party. </p><p class="endmark">When asked after his news conference Thursday if the protests would change his attitude toward policy in the Israel-Hamas war, Biden emphatically responded, “No.” Expect the protesters to double down just as firmly as they say “no” to a heinous war.\xa0</p></div></div></body></html>'}

They are also one reason many Americans don\'t put their money in banks at all. The administration’s proposed limit on bank fees is a good start to remedying this problem. But if Biden wants to do more to help those who can least afford unexpected bank fees, he could look at expanding an often-overlooked program that is already directly providing millions of people with access to banking with low fees.</p><p class="">First, it\'s important to understand how significant bank fees are.</p><p class="">For many lower-income families, unexpected fees are not just an annoyance but potentially a reason they might not be able to afford gas or groceries that week. According to the CFPB, the share of lower-income households that have had to pay overdraft or non-sufficient funds fees in a given year was <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-issues-report-showing-many-americans-are-surprised-by-overdraft-fees/" target="_blank">dramatically higher</a> than among middle- and upper-class families.</p><p class="">As a result, many low-income households choose to skip banks and rely on check-cashing services, money orders and payday lenders. Those come with fees, too, but unlike overdraft fees, they aren\'t deducted without your awareness, said Prasad Krishnamurthy, a Berkeley law professor who has studied the economics of lower-income Americans. That makes it easier to plan for monthly bills like rent and electricity.</p><p class="">"When you go into the check-cashing service, it\'s like McDonald\'s," he said. "There\'s a big board that shows you everything they charge. There\'s no hidden fees. If you like the price, you buy."</p><p class="">A <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2021-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2020-banking-and-credit.htm" target="_blank">study by the Federal Reserve</a> found that in 2021, 5% of U.S. adults had no bank account at all and another 13% were underbanked — meaning they had bank accounts but still regularly relied on check-cashing and money order services. In addition, 40% of Black people and 30% of Hispanics were unbanked or underbanked. </p><p class="">New limits on overdraft fees are one way to get more people into the banking system. But if Biden wants to go further, there\'s a program administered by the Treasury Department that\'s ripe for expansion.</p><p class="">Called Direct Express, the program provides a MasterCard-branded debit card to <a href="https://www.frbservices.org/news/communications/020224-treasury-fasp-direct-express-program" target="_blank">nearly 4 million people</a> who receive federal payments such as Social Security, disability and veterans\' benefits and a handful of smaller retirement programs. The cards have no monthly account fees and minimal or no fees for most routine banking tasks, such as withdrawing money from ATMs or getting cash back at the store. Started in 2011 as the federal government sought to move away from mailing checks and toward direct deposit, the program now handles <a href="https://fiscal.treasury.gov/files/directexpress/DirectExpressFASPQandAs.pdf" target="_blank">$3 billion in federal benefits every month</a>.</p><p class="">Direct Express does have some limitations. Cardholders can\'t put their own money onto the cards —\xa0making them more like prepaid gift cards from your grandma than true checking accounts — and they apply to only a handful of federal benefits. There have also been <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/comerica-in-serious-violation-of-treasurys-direct-express-program" target="_blank">complaints about the private vendor</a> that handles the cards, Comerica Bank, especially over <a href="https://www.kgw.com/article/news/investigations/oregon-man-unauthorized-charges-social-security-benefits-fraud-claim-denied/283-d3e80f00-f262-485e-b464-03f1c80b1e17" target="_blank">how it responded</a> to identity theft and fraud cases.</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">Direct Express has received high marks from cardholders in a customer satisfaction survey.</p></div><p class="">Nevertheless, Direct Express has received <a href="https://directexpress.info/2022/08/09/cardholder-survey-shows-satisfaction-ongoing-impact-of-covid-19/" target="_blank">high marks from cardholders</a> in a customer satisfaction survey, and there have been periodic calls to expand the program. During the coronavirus pandemic, the Treasury Department used Direct Express to make stimulus payments and send advance child tax credits to existing cardholders. Some have called for the government to expand the program to <a href="https://www.frbsf.org/wp-content/uploads/Holt_Steve.pdf" target="_blank">include direct payments</a> for lower-income families or <a href="https://prospect.org/power/reform-bill-reinforces-authority-for-postal-banking/" target="_blank">install ATMs at U.S. Postal Service</a> branches where cardholders could add money to the cards.</p><p class="">At an even broader level, the program could be opened up to people who aren\'t receiving benefit payments, making it something like a "<a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/3/public-option-bankingfinancepostofficedirectexpress.html" target="_blank">public option</a>" for basic banking services that lower-income families aren\'t getting right now.</p><p class="endmark">Expanding the program wouldn\'t necessarily hurt banks, which already largely ignore this group of potential customers. If that becomes a concern, limits could be put on how much money can be kept in the accounts.

(AMI), which published the National Enquirer</a>, testified last week that paying for exclusive stories to publish — a practice that Pecker called “checkbook journalism” — had long been a part of AMI’s toolbox. Pecker was equally forthcoming about his willingness to pay for other exclusive stories for the sole purpose of killing them, as AMI did with Karen McDougall’s tale of her 10-month affair with a married Trump. Pecker also acknowledged that Michael Cohen, working on behalf of Trump, <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/gary-farro-testimony-trump-hush-money-trial-rcna149837" target="_blank">paid Stormy Daniels $130,000</a> to buy her silence and her story about their sexual encounters for the National Enquirer, with the understanding that the Enquirer would kill the story to benefit Trump’s candidacy.\xa0His testimony was corroborated by Keith Davidson, the attorney for McDougall and Daniels, who received the payments on behalf of both women.</p><p class="">Freedom of the press is the right of a publisher to decide, without interference by the government, what to publish.\xa0That right is enshrined in the Constitution’s First Amendment, which provides that “Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.”\xa0In our Constitution, then, the right to a free press is on equal footing with the right to exercise one’s religion or assemble peacefully.</p><p class="">In fact, freedom of the press is so important to us that we give unusual leeway to journalists. For example, the <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/70-85" target="_blank">U.S. Supreme Court has </a>acknowledged that subpoenaed journalists may have a right in some circumstances not to reveal the reporter’s sources (that is, a court must balance the reporter’s First Amendment rights against a party’s need for the subpoenaed information). In the wake of that 1972 Supreme Court decision, <a href="https://www.rcfp.org/introduction-to-the-reporters-privilege-compendium/" target="_blank">40 states enacted “shield laws”</a> that allow journalists to withhold the identities of their confidential sources; most federal courts have followed suit, and almost all the remaining states and courts offer some kind of judicial protection for journalists’ confidential sources.</p><p class="">In return, of course, journalists often take immense risks. Since 1993, <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/safety-journalists/observatory" target="_blank">UNESCO reports over 1,660 journalists</a> worldwide have been killed as a result of performing their duties. In 2022,<a href="https://rsf.org/en/new-record-number-journalists-jailed-worldwide" target="_blank"> a record 533 journalists were in detention</a> around the world, according to Reporters Without Borders. In our country, the heavy price that the journalistic community pays, and the accommodations it receives in return, support our constitutional right to see, hear and evaluate for ourselves published facts and opinions.\xa0</p><p class="">A free press is a bedrock of American democracy.\xa0We protect our free press because we have seen what happens in countries that don’t.\xa0But in this trial, prosecutors have illustrated, once again, Trump’s willingness to take something earned by others and corrupt it for his own benefit. This hardly comes as a surprise, as Trump has previously derided other important institutions — the Department of Justice, the FBI, the courts — when they did not bend to his personal wishes. But now we see how readily Trump gave away even our ability to see facts with our own eyes.</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">Now we see how readily Trump gave away even our ability to see facts with our own eyes.\n</p></div><p class="">David Pecker, who considers himself a businessman, did things that were far from laudable. Yet if the First Amendment guarantees a publisher the right to publish what he wishes, perhaps a publisher also has a right not to publish, for whatever reason. But Trump, as the head of a company and a candidate for president, had to abide by different set of rules, including New York state business rules, campaign finance laws and tax laws. More to the point, a presidential candidate who swears to “preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States” should not be someone who undermines the First Amendment by paying to suppress information relevant to voters.</p><p class="">In his opening statement, Trump’s attorney Todd Blanche tried mightily to convince the jury that there is nothing to see here. “There is nothing illegal,” Blanche said, about buying negative stories for the purpose of killing them or insisting on nondisclosure agreements. “I have a spoiler alert,” he told the jury. “There is nothing wrong with trying to influence an election.

It’s my niece’s birthday.\xa0It’s Mika Brzezinski’s birthday. It’s all very exciting. I’m Jennifer Palmieri, and I’m here with my co-host Claire McCaskill. Hey, Claire.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: Hey, so guess what happened this week?</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Oh my God, what?</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: For the first time, Donald Trump actually was held accountable for his words. We have in writing from a duly qualified sitting judge in the United States of America that his words have caused him to be found in contempt. And I think it’s worth it.\xa0</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: Just like, you know, we should have confetti dropped from the sky or something.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Barrister McCaskill wants to relish this moment.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: Yes, yes.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: The courts delivered some validation and justice.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: Yes, yes.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Good, that is good. So, and this week, as the Biden administration continues to negotiate for a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, student protests across the country have everyone’s focus, which is the point, right? And Florida’s six-week abortion ban is now in full effect, making much of the southern half of our country out of reach for access to care.\xa0</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: Well, with this backdrop, Jen and I want to check in with Cristina Tzintzun-Ramirez. She’s the executive director of NextGen America, and we want her take on how to engage young voters. What concerns? Is it Gaza? Is it abortion rights? Is it immigration? Are resonating with the newest generation to head to the ballot box?</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: And there’s one state that seems to be taking on every issue that will affect the 2024 election, from immigration to abortion rights to inflation to election deniers, and that’s Arizona. So, Claire and I want to throw a spotlight on the Grand Canyon state as a roadmap for November.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: But first, we’re going to do our if we were in the room strategy session and we’re going to spend some time on, this is Jen’s favorite word today. I know she’s going to say it a number of times in this podcast. The “Time” interview with Trump was bonkers. It was just bonkers. And I really urge people to read it and share it with people you know because it is so bad. The things he said, and I know the Biden team is trying to amplify this interview and what Trump is saying that he’s going to do, what he’s campaigning on, but they need to do more. There’s some really scary stuff in there.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Right.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: So, if you had to pick something in that interview that the campaign should focus on, Jen, if you were in the room with them, what would you tell them to focus on?</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Well, I think they lift up everything, which is smart, but I think they need better tactics to have something stick and break through. So, for example, it’s not just “Time Magazine,” right? This morning, the “Milwaukee Journal Sentinel” published an interview with him because he was in Wisconsin yesterday, and he would not commit to accepting the results of Wisconsin’s presidential election, right?</p><p class="">So, it’s like violence is left open. He’s going to decide if it’s fair or not. It’s the exact same thing that happened before. We know that 20 percent of Republican voters continue to express concerns about him. You have to pick a place that’s relevant to the issue to make it break through. You know, go to Arizona. Go specifically stand out in front of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors place where they count votes.</p><p class="">That was the scene of protests and, you know, people having their lives in danger because they were working for the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors trying to just count people’s votes. Go to the place in Philadelphia where they’re counting votes there where people were threatened. Remind everyone exactly what that felt like, but I think you need the visual, you need a connection to Trump.</p><p class="">Also, by the way, remember when Biden went to the border, Trump followed him there. And then that was a way that Biden really broke through. Biden’s challenge is breaking through. And if you go to someplace that’s meaningful to people, but also meaningful to Trump, or perhaps there’s a history of Trump going there, you might bait him into the fight, too, which is, again, what you really need to do to get traction.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: So here’s an interesting thing that I thought about. And I think if I were in the room, I would suggest this. I think you’re right. You need to go to the scene of the crime, so to speak --\xa0</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: -- to really break through. And you need to be disciplined about maybe picking no more than one or two of the craziest things to keep hammering. But this thing he’s trying to do on abortion is fascinating to me because he is saying over and over again, first of all, he is proud of blowing up Roe v. Wade.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Yes.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: And second of all, that it’s okay whatever the states want to do. So it seems to me that this is time for Biden to show up at a red state. It seems to me it’s time for Biden to show up somewhere where he’s not going to win the electoral votes just to highlight what Trump is embracing.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: Trump is embracing monitoring women’s pregnancies.\xa0</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: I mean, seriously, I mean, we’re talking about putting bounty on people who are trying to help loved ones get a safe and legal abortion. We’re talking about trying to outlaw medical abortions. I mean, he needs to go to a state the next time there is a breakout story, and there will be one, I promise you, of someone who’s been a victim of rape or incest or someone who has been near death because of a miscarriage, being prosecuted for a miscarriage.</p><p class="">He needs to get one of those times. And if it’s in a red state, he needs to go there because this is what Trump says is okay.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: And I think it really underlines the whole issue that, frankly, is going to move voters to the polls and it’s going to provide the margin of victory for him, this issue.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. And, you know, tacticians will say, oh, you shouldn’t go to a red state because that’s a waste. He should just go to a battleground state. And I have never subscribed to that view because I think, first of all, he’s president of the United States and he should go everywhere. American presidents should go everywhere. It shouldn’t matter who the people voted for.\xa0</p><p class="">And women in Mississippi and Alabama and Florida, Texas, I think they would love to know that the president of the United States, vice president of the United States had their back, right? And I think that when you go to a red state, it breaks through in a way that it doesn’t if you’re making your ninth trip to Michigan, although he loves Michigan, you should like spend a lot of time there. But there’s something to be said about how you break through.</p><p class="">And the vice president to this point did go to Florida. We have audio from her talking about this issue yesterday where she went smartly in the day that the bill took effect.</p><p class="">(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p class="">Kamala Harris: So, Florida, the contrast in this election could not be more clear. Basically, under Donald Trump, it would be fair game for women to be monitored and punished by the government, whereas Joe Biden and I have a different view. We believe the government should never come between a woman and her doctor.</p><p class="">(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: So other things he said that are batshit crazy. First of all, he says he’s fine with firing anybody at the Department of Justice who doesn’t prosecute who he wants them to prosecute.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah.\xa0</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill:\xa0That sends a cold shiver down my spine. Pardoning J6, all those people who attacked police officers and the fact that he’s going to make sure he has some kind of vetting test, get rid of longtime good civil servants and substitute in people who swear that the election was stolen in 2020. I mean, this is all really crazy stuff.</p><p class="">And it’s like he doesn’t think people are listening or paying attention because this is not how he wins moderate voters, crossover swing voters. It just seems to me that the campaign has a real opportunity with the more he talks, the more opportunity they have, the discipline that’s going to be needed is just not to go everywhere.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: And he’s really, you know, he always tells you exactly who he is. That’s what he’s doing now. And I think what comes through in these interviews that’s so important is he’s pissed. He’s pissed that he didn’t get into office last time because he knows he lost. He’s pissed about that. And he’s pissed that he tolerated people, that he said, you know, I won’t be so nice next time, right?</p><p class="">So this is like, you know, you always need to believe what he says. But it does feel like it’s a little different this time that it is as bad as it was. This is Trump with a vendetta.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: Yeah. So what about the third party stuff? What would you be telling them in the room on the third party stuff right now?</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Oh my God, geez.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: Because RFK did this bizarre, let’s do a poll in October and whoever’s polling better gets to stay in and the other has to drop out. I mean, are they doing enough and should they be doing more?</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: I don’t have a, you know, I wish I had a silver bullet on this. And I think that they are doing a lot. You know, they have very talented people working at the Democratic Party that are working to define him. What I think they’re doing that I think is smart is they are messaging that he is crazy. He has unconventional views. He has right wing-ish views. He’s propped up by MAGA world and they haven’t done as much. Voting for him is going to throw this into Trump. I think they’re going to get there. I think they’re trying to sequence this.</p><p class="">Now Trump is upset about RFK and is worried that RFK Jr. will help Biden. Regardless, I think that the Biden team needs to say there’s one way to beat Donald Trump and that’s to vote for Joe Biden. And they need to also message that this guy is weirdly propped up in some ways by the MAGA world and just keep him in that lane because that’s the least appealing to voters and it probably can be sustained the longest.\xa0</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: Yeah, well, it would help if people would also realize there’s a Cornel West problem. Now, he’s not on the ballot in any of the swing states yet, but that’s not saying he won’t get there. And then there’s Jill Stein. Is she on the Green Party line? I mean, they’re on the ballot in 19 states, the Green Party. Is that Jill Stein? Is that who that is or are they not nominated yet? I need to pay closer attention, don’t I?</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: I don’t know either. I think she is.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: Okay.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, I don’t know.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: Yeah, we need to look into that because Jill Stein showed up in St. Louis on the Wash U campus. She was arrested as part of the protest here. And also the administration reclassified marijuana. I mean, to me, that’s an asterisk. I mean, it’s like kind of too late. You talk about the cow being out of the fricking barn.\xa0</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: I know. But you know, without a change of federal law, there’s not a lot you can do.\xa0</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: Yeah. And by the way, it’s legal in most states and the federal government’s not prosecuting marijuana now. So it’s more of a banking issue than anything else, I think, for legitimate marijuana businesses in states where it’s been legalized. But half of the states have said it’s okay to use marijuana recreationally. Thirty-eight have said it’s okay for medicinal use, which is just shortcut for you’ve got to work a little harder to use it recreationally legal.</p><p class="">My understanding is in the states that just had medical, you can just go get a doctor’s slip from a number of doctors and it’s not hard to get marijuana. So, good issue for young voters. But as our next guest will explain to us, probably not as big as some of the other ones that the youth vote is going to be looking at.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: So when we come back, Christina Tzintzun-Ramirez, President and Executive Director of NextGen America, stops by to talk about getting out the youth vote, the college campus protests over Gaza and what top issues are resonating with young voters. Back with Christina in a moment.\xa0</p><p class="">(ADVERTISEMENT)</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: Welcome back. Unless you’ve been living in a cave this week, you are well aware of the ongoing protest and unrest and chaos, frankly, on college campuses around the country in support of a ceasefire in Gaza and universities divesting from companies with financial ties to Israel. This has been powerful. The news even reached students in Gaza who showed a sign of support for what was going on, on campus in America.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Most protests have been peaceful. Some have escalated to violence. We saw a lot of footage of Columbia University, UCLA. But the showing of mass demonstration efforts does have poll watchers and candidates taking note. I would note that as high profile as these protests have been, the conflict in Gaza continues to pull low in issues that young people care about. So, we want to know what issues are the most urgent to this voting bloc and how can Democrats reach these key voters that Biden’s going to need to win?</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: We are thrilled to have with us today Christina Tzintzun-Ramirez. She is the</p><p class="">President and Executive Director of NextGen America. She joins us now to talk about what this newest voting bloc wants and what issues motivate them. And should we be really worried about whether or not they’re going to show up for Joe Biden? Christina, we’re really glad to have you.</p><p class="">Christina Tzintzun-Ramirez: Thanks so much for having me. Glad to be here.\xa0</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: Yeah, thanks. We really appreciate you being here.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: All right let’s talk about the student protest. Part of the stated purpose of what they’re trying to do is to get their universities to divest from Israel. Are you paying attention to this? Can you tell us what has happened? Are they having success in accomplishing that?</p><p class="">Christina Tzintzun-Ramirez: Yeah, I think just take a step back on like where young people are at on this issue and why we see this big generational divide, right. You are correct. In our polling and other people’s polling this is not a top issue for the youth voter electorate, which the youth vote is going to be critical for Biden and Democrats to win this upcoming election. But we do see a huge jump in young people caring about foreign policy and stating it as important for the upcoming election than in previous elections. So just as an example, in 2022 --</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah.</p><p class="">Christina Tzintzun-Ramirez: -- when young people were asked about how important was foreign policy for their voting in the midterms, just 4 percent said it was going to be important. Of course, Ukraine was at the forefront, right? Now, it’s 84 percent, so it’s an important issue in the upcoming election. We see that close to 70 percent of young people disapprove of the Biden administration’s handling of the conflict, have strong feelings about wanting a ceasefire and questions and concerns about the Israeli government’s what they see as response that has, you know, even according to Biden has been over the top, right?</p><p class="">And so young people using the same tactics of the apartheid struggle that ended apartheid in South Africa are using a call for divestment from their campuses. And so this is the beginning of that movement in this country and so we’re seeing different responses. Students at Brown University, the University of Brown said, okay, we will take it up for debate and students closed down their encampment and they’re going to take it up for debate as a vote in October.</p><p class="">So I think we still don’t know what’s going to happen. Everybody’s asking me what’s going to look like in October? Look, it’s changed in 48 hours very dramatically.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: Right. Totally.</p><p class="">Christina Tzintzun-Ramirez: So I don’t think we exactly know. Will this be an important issue for activists? Yes, it will be. Is it going to be for the overall electorate that are young people that are very critical voting bloc that vote overwhelmingly Democratic and progressive and have really almost wholesale rejected the Republican Party? No. But in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, you don’t need that many young people when we need to hold by just a few votes to decide to vote third party or set out an election to have an impact.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: So it’s interesting to me because I was young, but I remember --</p><p class="">Christina Tzintzun-Ramirez: Claire, you’re so young at heart to me.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: I love that.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Youth is a vibe and Claire has got it.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: You have to come back every week, Christina, every week. But I remember the campuses during Vietnam and I remember when it got violent. I remember Kent State. I remember all of that. The interesting thing is the Vietnam conflict people were losing their brothers. They were losing their friends. Their loved ones were being drafted. I mean, Americans were dying, young Americans. So it really gripped the country. And in a way, it is surprising to me that this has taken hold as it has since we have no soldiers there. We have no young people who are being forced because they’re in the military to go and wage this war.</p><p class="">And I wonder, is it social media that is the differential at this point? Do you think that is part of it? Why do you think it has jumped so much in terms of people caring about it, even though we are not directly participating in this war?</p><p class="">Christina Tzintzun-Ramirez: Yes, I think this is the most progressive generation in American history. We think about the ‘60s as a high watermark, and it was a high watermark. But overall, if you look at voting patterns, behaviors, beliefs, this is the most diverse generation. They have a lot of questions, concerns. They are very social justice oriented. And they also have the ability now, right? People had young people friends. You said their brothers, cousins, friends dying.</p><p class="">And so that was the image that came home to them of people coming home and caskets are never being found right in Vietnam. Now people are able to see the devastation happening in Palestine and really the unevenness of that and seeing how many children have died and asking themselves, if you look at young people’s attitudes and beliefs, right, questions and concerns about how much American tax dollars are going to that feeling like they have a vested interest in it because they’re paying for it in some aspects.\xa0</p><p class="">And if you look at pretty progressive social media saying, why are we spending all that money on war there? Why are we not spending it here at home? There are just so many needs here for health care, for housing. We want that money to come home. And so I think that those questions are being raised. This is a very educated population. Again, I don’t think it’s the overall youth electorate. However, information is able to spread much more rapidly than you would have back in the day without social media.</p><p class="">And I also think it’s interesting. We look at the 1960s and these protests were about to reach summer. So a lot of these campuses are going to close down. I think we’re going to see the protests dissipate. But I also think you’re going to see young people stay connected in a way that would have been much harder in previous times because of social media.</p><p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"></p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: Right.</p><p class="">Christina Tzintzun-Ramirez: And so I think this is a question for the leadership within the Biden administration about how they handle this conflict, because it’s not just young people, right? Overwhelmingly within the Democratic Party, people want a ceasefire. It’s much higher for younger people. But I think we’re seeing a divide within the Democratic Party base and the administration’s policy position overall.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: Yeah, I think the ceasefire is easy to agree to. The harder thing is the right of Israel to exist. And clearly these protests have been embracing a position that I think most Americans would soundly reject, that Israel needs to no longer exist as it currently exists. And that is the problem, I think. Frankly, it’s a problem that if it was easy to solve, it would have been solved decades ago. This is really, really hard stuff.</p><p class="">Christina Tzintzun-Ramirez: And we’re seeing that in our own polling. We saw that overwhelmingly young people support a ceasefire, do not approve of how the conflict has been handled. But when you ask them, well, what is the resolution? There’s a real divide. And so I think that we’re practicing in this real moment what the actual outcome will be. And I think that we have to remember for the young people, you know, we organize and move young people. We have endorsed Joe Biden. We want him to win. We realize the threat that Donald Trump poses.</p><p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"></p><p class="">And we recently supported a ceasefire as well, because that’s where most young people are at. And so for us, it’s been about also saying and understanding that Donald Trump on this issue is far, far worse. And Jared Kushner has even, you know, talked about beachfront, waterfront property in Gaza and how we need to take over the land because it’s very valuable. So, like, let’s be clear about what the threat is on the other side as well.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: I think it’s interesting. We’re talking about the more progressive sector of the youth population. So let’s acknowledge that. But to stick with this notion that they are, as you said, very concerned about foreign policy, that’s really interesting. I imagine Gaza is a big part of that. You know, I’m in my 50s. Some of my colleagues, I’m like, oh, well, these young people, they’re just finding out about the conflict from TikTok and they don’t know the history. I think that there’s just something bigger with the progressive side of the youth that it’s not like we’re not interested in the history. But we don’t think those ways have worked.\xa0</p><p class="">We don’t think that the judgments that were made over the last, you know, several decades on a lot of issues when it comes to how indigenous people are treated, when it comes to climate change, when it comes to guns in America, when it comes to Middle East policy, that there’s something more like this isn’t just a one issue concern I imagine.</p><p class="">I don’t want to say a wholesale rejection, but a lot of skepticism about what has come before and sort of assumptions made of how the U.S. should lead in the world and how the U.S. should operate its economy justice system in the U.S. Is this just about Gaza or do you think that there’s something else, you know, a broader concern roiling there about how we approach governing this country?</p><p class="">Christina Tzintzun-Ramirez: I think that’s a really, really important point, Jen. Look at attitudes, values of young people. You know, this is the first generation in American history to be worse off than their parents economically. This is a generation that, you know, yeah, when people were younger, they talked about climate change and the environment, and we’re just beginning to see the impacts that it will have over people’s lives and total destruction over our environment and earth and planet that young people are inheriting.</p><p class="">So, yeah, you might feel like you’ve inherited a pretty raw deal if you’re a young person. And also, this is the most diverse generation in American history. We just went through the uprisings across the country around George Floyd. And this generation is really also calling for a reckoning about the story we tell about the American experience. And so I think that is all part of what is happening both within the Democratic Party and our country. I do think what’s exciting about when we see what’s happening with young people is they are pushing and forcing our country to wrestle with big problems.</p><p class="">So just mention Black Lives Matter movement. Talking about the fact that we got the Inflation Reduction Act, the single largest investment by any country on the planet to tackle the climate crisis, which the Biden-Harris administration moved forward. That’s a lot of response to young people’s impatience and questions on that issue. The student debt crisis, gun safety, these movements where we’re seeing legislators take bold positions are also in part because young people are really building the electoral muscle and the movement muscle on the ground.</p><p class="">And we have to understand they work in tandem. And so I think that young people are clearly choosing the Democratic Party as the party through their votes, as the party that they’re going to remake the vision of the country they want to see.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: So in looking at the Harvard Youth Poll, one thing that I kind of honed in on, and we talked about this earlier in this podcast, about Trump’s latest interview with “Time Magazine” and some of the things he said as it regards immigrants. Now, to me, if you look at the responses in the Harvard Youth Poll on immigration, you see that people under the age of 30 do not see immigrants as enemy combatants. They do not view them overall as a negative for our country. They work with immigrants. They have good friends that are immigrants. They’ve gone to school with immigrants. They think they help our culture. They don’t think it is a harm to our culture.</p><p class="">I mean, if you had to pick one, Christine, if you had to pick one issue to really push to the youth about the danger of Donald Trump to the values that young people hold, which one would you pick? Because it seems like there’s a real problem with immigration that Trump would have with young people, the way he is viewing rounding them up and putting them in camps and calling out the military and doing massive deportations. I mean, to me, not that the problem in Gaza is not horrific and not that people shouldn’t feel passionate about it. That, to me, would be a big deal to the youth of this country.</p><p class="">Christina Tzintzun-Ramirez: I mean, I remember 2016, I was six months pregnant and I had thought Hillary was going to win. And my father’s child is a dreamer. So that means he came to this country when he was undocumented as a child and we hadn’t fixed his paperwork because it takes time. And I have never felt so afraid in my life the night that Donald Trump won. It’s like I’m holding this baby in my body or like this was going to be my first child. And Trump is saying that he’s going to rip our family apart like and call my child an anchor baby, like an innocent, beautiful baby.</p><p class="">And so I’m very clear that like immigration is also about our power. Like I’m the daughter of an immigrant. I’m raised by a good white American hippie, my dad and my Mexican mom. And, you know, I’m very clear that Donald Trump and those folks are not just afraid of five, six to two year old immigrant Mexican mom, but they are deeply afraid of me, her daughter, a U.S. citizen that understands this country is mine and understands all of my rights and doesn’t want anything to do with the vision that they are purporting is a vision for our country.</p><p class="">But I think when we dig in and look at our polling, Harvard’s Youth Voting Poll, abortion, abortion, abortion, it is very clear, especially for young people of reproductive age. And we saw it in 2022 with young women saying abortion’s my top issue. Now it’s actually young men and young women because men caught up, you know, straight men that are having sex with women caught up and are like, oh, shit, this is going to also impact me and deciding when I get to have a family, a baby, and then just talking about the threat of democracy.</p><p class="">You have to remember, some young people that are 18 years old were 10 years old when Donald Trump won. And they don’t fully remember because they probably had good parents that shielded them from hearing the cries of babies being ripped from their mothers at the border, from the sight of Heather Heyer being run over by white supremacists that he called some of very fine people and saying he liked to grab women by the pussy. They probably don’t remember that because their parents had shielded them from that. And so that’s what we have to educate and remind young people about. And then they are very clear to turn out and vote for Democrats.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: What a concept that parents have to do that. You know, I said all along that the way we fix this problem, the way this election becomes a runaway is we just need to let men be able to get pregnant, because if men could get pregnant, they would feel as strongly about this as women do. And there’s a real difference.</p><p class="">Christina Tzintzun-Ramirez: Landslide. It would be a landslide. Oh my God.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: Yeah. At least in the Harvard poll, it was like, it was unbelievable the difference between the support for Biden among men versus women. I mean, women, it was like 33 points and men, it was like six or seven. And it was like --</p><p class="">Christina Tzintzun-Ramirez: Yeah.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: Okay, you know, we feel this more than you do, guys and you need to get on board here. What about what’s working and talking to young people, right? The media ecosystem is so disparate. What does work? What do you find in works and reach people?</p><p class="">Christina Tzintzun-Ramirez: Yeah, I think what we have to remember is like social media is important, but also who’s loudest online is not necessarily like where the general electorate is at. And so the general youth electorate are really focused on abortion, their rights to decide what happened with their own bodies, their own health, when they decide to make a family, they’re pretty pissed that some older white guys mostly decided for them and took away their rights back 50 years.</p><p class="">And they should be pissed and we’re glad that they’re pissed. And that’s motivating that I see what happens in Arizona, in Florida with a six-week abortion ban or trying to take us back to 1864 before women could vote in Arizona and you start to realize, like, what is the vision that they’re crafting for our country is just so backwards. And so those are the top issues. Of course, the economy is a top issue for young people this election.</p><p class="">But I think the Biden administration’s vision on economic policy actually really aligns with young people. So young people, 88 percent of young people support labor unions. There is only one candidate in this race.\xa0</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: It’s amazing. It’s amazing. I do some work with labor unions and it’s amazing what’s happening.\xa0</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: But what actual tactics work? I mean, I know that the Biden campaign is doing a lot of digital ads, for example. You know, we can argue against Trump. I feel like, you know, these are going to be the leaders of tomorrow. They’re leading today. I feel like they need to know Biden’s theory of the case, what he’s accomplished, have some faith that things can get better, right. It seems like you don’t want to lose the thread of what the Biden-Harris administration has done. Like, what do you think about telling that story? And then just be really interested to hear what tactically, what kind of communication channels work best.</p><p class="">Christina Tzintzun-Ramirez: Yeah. So for us at NextGen, we’ve found that we have to have a holistic surround sound approach to organizing young people. So we’re in eight key states this election, on 112 college campuses, community colleges, having hundreds of thousands of conversations with our volunteers and organizers this election about these key issues, about what’s at stake at this election. We always start with the issues and what young people care about, because young people care about progressive policy first and foremost. And then the candidate is secondary.</p><p class="">We know that talking about the threat Donald Trump poses is critical, but we also have to talk about the accomplishments of the Biden administration on progressive policy. And in my lifetime, this is the president that has delivered more progressive policy than any president, hands down. And it’s very much aligned with where young people are at. And I think that’s the other thing we have to realize is you totally have a right to be upset if you are upset about what is happening in Gaza and Palestine and the administration’s position. But if you organize, you need to think about who is the candidate I can push the most.</p><p class="">And there is no pushing Donald Trump on this issue. We got a lot done in four years. You want more? You haven’t gotten everything you wanted? Then elect Biden and Harris again, because you can push them in the right direction. So I think those are the important issues. And then, of course, reaching on social media is important with the right messengers and messages. We’ve never paid for a TV ad at NextGen, nor will we ever. We’ve always worked with influencers and on social media.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: Before we wrap this up, I got to get one more in. Are you worried about the youth as it relates to RFK, Jill Stein and Cornel West?</p><p class="">Christina Tzintzun-Ramirez: Yeah, so we saw in our poll that 20 percent of young people said they were thinking about voting third party this election. But we also saw that that support was really soft. So as soon as they learned about like more about Biden and Trump, quickly you were able to cut that number in half. So I am very worried about it. I have a confession, Claire, and I hope you’ll still like me and Jen, which is that in 2000, it was my first election ever and I voted for Ralph Nader in Ohio. And I think back about like my vote, along with a few others, could have added up to the difference.</p><p class="">And we would have moved on climate policy twenty something years ago, we would have not had the war in Iraq. Like I was not thinking clearly or understanding the consequences of what that meant. When I think about where we could be 20 years from now, if we re-elect Trump, that’s very terrifying. And so we need to make that very clear to young people.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Joe Scarborough made the point to me recently that if it were not for Ralph Nader and Jill Stein, there would not have been a Republican president elected in this century.\xa0</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: There you go.\xa0</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Isn’t that bonkers?</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: It is bonkers.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Hello, people. That’s great.\xa0</p><p class="">Christina Tzintzun-Ramirez: And look at how much more we’ve gotten done. If you’re a young progressive, look how much more we’ve gotten done by working within the Democratic Party than shouting at the gates on the outside and not even being able to move. Inflation Reduction Act, gun safety, student debt, you name it, we’ve moved.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Okay, so like the big fear is like people will not turn out or that the double haters, the people who are turned off by Biden, turned off by Trump will stay home. You’re going to be doing a lot of messaging in the campaigns. We do a lot of messaging between now and the election to young people. Like, how are you feeling about this? Are they so turned off that they won’t turn out?\xa0</p><p class="">Christina Tzintzun-Ramirez: I mean, what you have to understand, 2022, there’s the headlines and then there’s behavior, right? Like so in 2022 and in 2020, if you read the headlines before the election, it was like young people down on Dems and not going to turn out, don’t like Biden. 2020 and ‘22 happened and young people turned out in record numbers and voted for Democrats in record numbers. In fact, they voted so overwhelmingly for Democrats in 2022 that it canceled out the Republican boomer vote, which makes up a much larger share of the electorate.</p><p class="">So we need young people to turn out. But it doesn’t happen without organizing. It doesn’t happen without understanding this is an audience you have to persuade. And I think the Biden administration needs to react and speak to the concerns that young people have on some of their foreign policy positions. For me, I absolutely will do everything for Biden and Harris to win again. And we’re going to organize and speak to millions of young people. But young people will give you heart palpitations because they like to turn out and make their mind up right before the election. So just to say, you know, like know the headlines, but know the behavior and trends we’re seeing with young people.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Okay, so like we’re way over, but what do you think that they should do? The Biden-Harris team should be doing? What is your advice for how they could better be dealing with the concerns over Gaza when it comes to young people?</p><p class="">Christina Tzintzun-Ramirez: I think that there needs to be a recognition and understanding that these are multi-faith, multi-racial coalitions. Jewish students have been very much at the forefront. And I think that is really critical to understand that there is a difference between folks having questions about the policies and procedures of the Israeli government and anti-Semitism, that those are actually distinct and different.</p><p class="">And so I think that it would be good for the administration to understand that. But they need to just listen to young people and try. And also their broad democratic coalition that is not fully aligned with them as far as their positions have been. We have not seen enough relief or humanitarian aid and movement, I think, as people would like to see. And that’s just very clear from polling. I can’t alone figure that out for the administration. But the administration needs to work hard to listen to its core base and constituencies because they need them to win this election.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: Christina Tzintzun-Ramirez, President and Executive Director of NextGen America. Thank you so much for spending some time with us today. It’s so good to hear your perspective, and hopefully we can have you back and you can give us heart palpitations in October about whether or not the youth vote is going to turn out in the margins they should for President Biden.</p><p class="">Christina Tzintzun-Ramirez: Yay! So great. Thank you so much.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: We’ll take a quick pause here, but when we’re back, we’ll spotlight a state that is knee-deep in all the issues that will be relevant in November. We’ll be right back.</p><p class="">(ADVERTISEMENT)</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: Welcome back. It’s been fascinating to watch the issues that are top of mind for the 2024 elections come into sharp focus. They continue to attack on women’s health, has fired up a huge cluster of voters, and so has immigration.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Pair that with inflation and the continued legal fallout from attempts to overturn the last election, and it’s quite a cocktail. One state has a host of these issues converging right now that makes it a perfect case study of 2024, and that is Arizona.\xa0</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: Yeah, Arizona is a deal --</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Man.\xa0</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: -- from top to bottom. You have everything going on in Arizona. The fight for democracy, the fight for women’s health, the fight for the United States Senate, the fight to defeat Kari Lake.\xa0</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: That’s what she means, friends. She means Kari Lake.\xa0</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: So here we go. Let’s go through them and try to quickly remind people that what’s going on in Arizona is truly a microcosm of what the issues are going to be that are going to matter if we’re going to win in 2024.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Okay, so we have abortion. So people remember that a few weeks ago, the Arizona Supreme Court upheld an 1864 law. Let’s just remind ourselves that was before women could vote. That was before Arizona was even a state. But they voted to repeal this yesterday. The state legislature did. Senate approved it. Two Republicans joined Arizona Democrats. This will likely make its way to a ballot initiative that’ll be on the ballot in November.</p><p class="">Some people said like, oh, the Democrats shouldn’t have done that because now it won’t be as salient as an issue. Couple things. If you can save women’s lives, you need to do it. So, you know, they needed to pass this law. My understanding, though, is that it is a 15-week ban, which we saw in Virginia, that’s what the Virginia Republican governor tried to run on that to win his midterm elections. It did not succeed, even though there’s kind of polling that has said that position has been popular.</p><p class="">I think my experience and also my experience in Arizona and being there in 2022, telling women in Arizona what they can and cannot do does not go over well. And it’s just, you know, going back to Sandra Day O’Connor, you know, the McCain family, you know, that really, really seemed to resonate with people. If you looked at the advertising in ‘22 with Mark Kelly, successful Senate race to be re-elected. Governor Katie Hobbs, she’s beat Kari like the last time. It was almost all abortion. So, it’s a big issue everywhere. I think it will continue to be a very big issue in Arizona.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: Yeah. And Arizona is the border state.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah.\xa0</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: I mean, they’ve had more migrants crossing the border in Arizona than any other section of the 2000 mile southern border this year and this fiscal year.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, they get it. They get immigration and what it means. And they don’t like people playing politics with it, playing games with it.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: Well, it’s a real issue for, you know, the moderate voters that are going to decide these elections in Arizona. They know something needs to be done. And you and I’ve talked about this before. We’re going to keep talking about it because I think how you win 2024 has a lot to do with leaning into the immigration problem and acknowledging why we want to be a country of immigrants, because we are and that there are so many positive things that people who come to this country contribute.</p><p class="">We’ve got a problem securing the border in a way that is lawful, legal and not chaotic. And I think that it’s going to be really important in Arizona to deal with that. And then, you know, talk a little bit about democracy in Arizona. That’s a big one there.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: It is a big one. I spent time in ‘22, like the week after the election, Tuesday to Sunday in Maricopa County, where they’re still counting ballots for the Senate race. And, you know, the trauma that that state went through, not just in ‘20, but recall there was recount after recount after recount, the ridiculous Cyber Ninja audit that Republicans in the state legislature required Maricopa County to do. Even the crazy Cyber Ninjas that were not on the side of the Democrats found that Joe Biden got four more votes than Arizona have found.</p><p class="">But they still accused Arizona or Maricopa County, in particular, of there having been some kinds of fraud. And even then, Maricopa County went through to their credit and refuted every single charge. I believe there was like 90 of them. But it’s been really interesting to watch how they combat disinformation. And it’s really the local leaders on the ground that are doing this.</p><p class="">They will not tolerate any disinformation. They’ve refuted and they do it right away in real time. And I could just feel it had an impact in that state. So when you start talking about we didn’t win here or, you know, that Biden didn’t win there, that really strikes a chord with Arizonans. And I think it’s more powerful there because of what they went through.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: And keep in mind that Republican Party --</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: And they got indicted last week.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: Yeah, that’s why I was just going to say.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: I was going to say that the people that control the Republican Party in Arizona are not the John McCain Republicans that Kari Lake wanted to tell them to get the hell out of the room and get the hell out of the Republican Party. It is all MAGA. I mean, this is actually what happened. They indict folks on the false elector scheme, including an unindicted co-conspirator by the name of Fat Orange Man sitting on a golf cart.</p><p class="">Then one of the guys that was indicted was elected by the Republican Party like a week later to be the Republican National Committeeman.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: So it is crazy. But I don’t think we can stop talking about Arizona without --</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah.</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: -- acknowledging an issue that I think that the White House has not yet figured out. And if we’re going to win in 2024, it is being realistic that while the overall inflation number has come down, inflation remains a huge issue for voters in this country. And nowhere do you feel that more acutely than in Arizona. Because there’s so much transition in their state, the housing costs are really important because people are more transient and there’s more income and there’s more shift. The housing costs, the interest rates, the food costs, it has really hit.</p><p class="">Arizona had some of the highest inflation in the country. And even though it’s better now, I think the White House, ignoring inflation in Arizona, they should do so at their own peril.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, because it is it’s not the same in every state. It’s a really important point. It’s really important point that, you know, housing prices in Arizona are so high and, you know, people are blaming interest rates for that. I have noticed a change in the messaging some but the president talks about bringing down costs and what he’s done to bring down costs. I know that some of the people that won in ‘22.</p><p class="">Whitmer was very effective at this. Her ads were mostly geared to here’s what I’ve done. Yes, things cost too much and not like the economy is doing better. Therefore, it’s okay. These are the specific steps I have taken to deal with costs and they probably need to do that here. Plus, the other thing with Arizona and closing out here is just that electorate is always changing. Vast demographic changes shifted Arizona, you know, reliably Republican, seldom contested to being up for grabs. Also people move in and out of that state a lot as well. It’s sort of a transient state.</p><p class="">So what it does in one cycle, you can’t count on the next. Biden’s not doing as well there right now as he ultimately did in ‘20. So it’s a really great microcosm of all of the issues.\xa0</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: Yep. And by the way, on inflation, I don’t think people realize what has happened in the food sector of our economy, the consolidation, the corporate consolidation and the fact that just a handful of companies are controlling food sometimes from the birth of an animal until the table and shrinkflation and the things they’ve done to lower portion sizes, but not the cost of the item, that there is big profit in these big corporations and there’s not enough competition.</p><p class="">So food costs are staying unnaturally high because of this corporate consolidation. I think it’s a real important piece for people. And if I were in the room, I’d be telling the Biden campaign to focus more on that because corporations are not exactly popular. And that really is part of the huge problem we have with food costs in America right now. It’s not the farmers that are making out. It’s these big corporate guys that are making out. Yeah.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Okay, by the way, our team here did fact check it for us. And Jill Stein is not yet the nominee for the Green Party. Their convention is in August. So she’s seeking the nomination.\xa0</p><p class="">Claire McCaskill: Oh, there you go. There you go.</p><p class="">Jennifer Palmieri: Okay. Thanks so much for listening.

What’s more, in the same remarks, the president said he was “directing my cabinet to review the federal classification of marijuana.”</p><p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"></p><p class="">Evidently, Biden meant it. NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/biden-administration-plans-reclassify-marijuana-easing-restrictions-na-rcna149424" target="_blank">reported</a> this week:</p><section class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote__quote"><p>The Biden administration will take a historic step toward easing federal restrictions on cannabis, with plans to announce an interim rule soon reclassifying the drug for the first time since the Controlled Substances Act was enacted more than 50 years ago, four sources with knowledge of the decision said.</p><p></p><small class="blockquote__source"><span></span></small></blockquote></section><p class="">It was Biden’s Department of Health and Human Services that concluded, after a year and a half of bureaucratic review, that marijuana should be reclassified from the strictest Schedule I, covering drugs such as heroin and methamphetamines, to Schedule III, which includes things like Tylenol with codeine and testosterone.</p><p class="">Now, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Justice Department are endorsing the move, marking the first time that federal officials have acknowledged potential medical benefits to marijuana and <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/marijuana-rescheduling-schedule-i-dea-rcna103040" target="_blank">opening the door to therapeutic research</a>.</p><p class="">It is, as an Associated Press <a href="https://apnews.com/article/marijuana-biden-dea-criminal-justice-pot-f833a8dae6ceb31a8658a5d65832a3b8" target="_blank">report</a> noted, the biggest policy change from federal officials on the issue “in more than 50 years.”</p><p class="">What’s more, a Politico <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/30/biden-weed-restriction-policies-00133123" target="_blank">report</a> added that rescheduling “will make it easier to research cannabis, something that scientists and public health officials have wanted for years. It also will move cannabis businesses out from under section 280E of the federal tax code, which prohibits them from writing off most basic business expenses and makes it exceedingly difficult to turn a profit.”</p><p class="">To be sure, this is a major breakthrough, though the shift in policy is not exactly imminent: NBC News’ <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/biden-administration-plans-reclassify-marijuana-easing-restrictions-na-rcna149424" target="_blank">report</a> added, “After the proposal is published in the Federal Register, there will be a 60-day public comment period. The proposal will then be reviewed by an administrative law judge, who could decide to hold a hearing before the rule is approved.”</p><p class="">In other words, reformers will have to be patient for a little while longer.</p><p class="">Nevertheless, this is, by any fair measure, a dramatic policy development and a progressive success story. But as a political matter, one of the most amazing things about the president’s latest move is how uncontroversial it is.</p><p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"></p><p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"></p><p class="">Indeed, it was easy to imagine Republicans responding to this week’s news with apoplectic broadsides about the seriousness of “gateway drugs.”</p><p class="">But that didn’t happen. A few GOP officials, including House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, offered <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-30/dea-recommends-reclassifying-marijuana-as-less-dangerous-drug" target="_blank">mild rebukes</a> in response to the administration’s move, but they were understated and bore no resemblance to the kind of hair-on-fire reaction we would’ve seen a generation ago.</p><p class="">In fact, for the most part, leading Republican voices simply don’t seem to care. The White House seems to realize that Biden can do the right thing on the issue without paying a political price — in part because GOP officials can read the polls and understand that tired clichés about marijuana don’t work the way they used to.</p><p class="">It’s extraordinary to see how much the landscape has changed in recent years. A decade ago, the total number of states allowing recreational marijuana use was zero, and at the national level, elected officials wanted nothing to do with reform proposals.</p><p class="">Now, 24 states have legalized cannabis for adult use; 37 states and Washington, D.C., have legalized medical marijuana; and the Biden administration is moving forward with reclassification plans with minimal pushback from its GOP detractors.</p><p class="">For decades, the United States’ “war on drugs” only moved in one punitive direction. As the latest developments help prove, it’s a new day.</p><p class="endmark"><em>This post updates our </em><a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/bidens-latest-move-marijuana-pardons-matters-rcna130929" target="_blank"><em>related earlier coverage</em></a>.</p></div></div></body></html>'}
{'<html><body><div><div class="article-body__content"><p class="">According to a recent New York Times report, Donald Trump vented that he does not have a “<a href="https://www.msnbc.com/katy-tur/watch/inside-the-mind-of-trump-s-ruthless-early-lawyer-roy-cohn-191052357790" target="_blank">Roy Cohn</a>,” a reference to his notoriously ruthless lawyer who was repeatedly indicted and disbarred.\xa0While Trump reportedly griped that <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-gag-order-trial-judge-merchan-todd-blanche-rcna148977" target="_blank">his lawyer Todd Blanche</a> has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/us/politics/trump-trial-todd-blanche.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare&amp;sgrp=c-cb" target="_blank">insufficiently aggressive</a>, Blanche has, in fact, employed the same kinds of aggressive tactics that made\xa0Cohn infamous. Cohn, who died in 1986, used delay to his advantage, was unapologetic in his belligerent attacks on others and had a reputation for breaking the rules.\xa0Taking a page out of Cohn’s playbook, Blanche has attacked prosecutors and the judge to delay the trial, has been unapologetic in defending <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-trial-michael-cohen-witness-credibility-rcna150237" target="_blank">Trump’s attacks on jurors and witnesses</a> and has already broken the rules by making improper arguments to the jury in his opening statement.\xa0</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">Blanche attacked the judge in the hopes of delaying the trial and advancing Trump’s false narrative that he’s the victim of political persecution. </p></div><p class="">With Blanche seemingly under pressure from Trump to display even more aggression, <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-trial-gag-order-hearing-merchan-rcna150292" target="_blank">Judge Juan Merchan </a>must be prepared to lay down the law and ensure that there will be serious consequences for any Cohn-style antics.</p><p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"></p><p class="">When Blanche accused the Manhattan district attorney’s office of violating its discovery obligations by not producing certain materials from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY),  Merchan <a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/4559850-trump-hush-money-judge-ny-trial/" target="_blank">scolded him. </a>“You’re literally accusing the Manhattan DA’s office and the people assigned to this case of prosecutorial misconduct and trying to make me complicit in it,” he said, “And you don’t have a single cite to support that position?”</p><p class="">Merchan noted that Blanche, as a former SDNY prosecutor,\xa0knew that he could have requested materials himself, yet he waited until <em>two months</em> before trial to request them. Blanche also waited until roughly <em>two weeks</em> before the scheduled trial to inform the court that he had requested materials from SDNY that could delay the trial.\xa0 His request to toss the case based on meritless prosecutorial misconduct accusations shortly before trial was an unusually brazen — and very Cohn-like — delay tactic.</p><p class="">Blanche also attacked the judge in the hopes of delaying the trial and advancing Trump’s false narrative that he’s\xa0the victim of political persecution. In August, Blanche’s motion for\xa0Merchan to recuse himself from the case <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-dubious-offensive-judges-daughter-part-ugly-pattern-rcna145464" target="_blank">based on his daughter’s employment</a> failed. Without significant new evidence or changed circumstances, Blanche made the motion again — less than two weeks before the scheduled trial date and two days after the court amended its gag order to protect the court’s family members. After Merchan denied the second recusal motion, Blanche had the audacity to sue the judge, and he moved — again unsuccessfully — to delay the trial pending appellate review. Criminal defense attorneys often use delay to their advantage, but suing the judge in a last-ditch attempt to delay the trial is an extremely combative move reminiscent of Cohn’s approach.</p><p class="">Blanche also has been unrepentant in defending Trump’s repeated attacks on jurors and witnesses in violation of the court’s gag order. When he made the absurd argument that Trump is trying to comply with the gag order (given his behavior), a frustrated Merchan responded: “You’re losing all credibility with the court.” While criminal defense attorneys should zealously advocate for their clients, Blanche has gone a step further to follow Cohn’s modus operandi and apologize for nothing.</p><p class="">Blanche has also made improper arguments to the jury. In his opening statement, Blanche disregarded the court’s evidentiary rulings and misstated the facts and law several times, drawing four objections that were sustained and two sidebars. Such flagrant Cohn-like rule-breaking right out of the gate in an opening statement is highly unusual. For example, when discussing hush money payments, Blanche stated that “you’ll hear this agreement was negotiated by lawyers.” That statement could mislead the jury to believe that Trump relied on the involvement of lawyers who blessed the hush money payment agreements.\xa0But the court had already ruled that Trump’s team could not even suggest this “presence of counsel” defense, so the state’s objection was sustained.</p><p class="">When describing Stormy Daniels’ threat to publicize her alleged sexual encounter with Trump, Blanche said it was “almost an attempt by Ms. Clifford/Ms. Daniels to extort President Trump.” But Daniels was never charged with extortion or attempted extortion; therefore Blanche’s suggestion of criminal wrongdoing by Daniels here was improper. Again, the state’s objection was sustained.</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">There’s reason to be concerned that Blanche might again refer to evidence the court has ruled off-limits — evidence that could confuse and mislead the jury and seriously prejudice the state’s case.</p></div><p class="">Given Blanche’s willingness to make improper arguments in his opening statement and Trump’s reported desire for Blanche to be more aggressive in attacking the judge and witnesses, there’s reason to be concerned that Blanche might again refer to evidence the court has ruled off-limits — evidence that could confuse and mislead the jury and seriously prejudice the state’s case.\xa0Those off-limit topics include SDNY’s opinion of Michael Cohen, SDNY’s decision not to prosecute Trump for campaign finance violations and\xa0 suggestions that\xa0District Attorney Alvin Bragg is biased against Trump and has improper political motivations.\xa0\xa0</p><p class="">Any move by Blanche to disregard the court’s rulings would represent an insidious attack on the court’s authority that could effectively disrupt the trial, draw the ire of Merchan, and likely result in sanctions. But if the thousand-dollar fines for Trump’s repeated gag order violations are any indication, that may be viewed as a small price to pay to improve the chances of a mistrial. After all, you can’t unring a bell; once the jury has heard evidence the judge says can’t be brought up, the damage is done.\xa0More importantly, the reward for a mistrial here cannot be overstated: Trump would score not only a massive legal victory, but a political one. And Blanche, having proven his “Roy Cohn” bona fides, would be able to write his own ticket to a plum position in any Trump administration. The risk-reward analysis is cause for alarm.</p><p class="endmark">Merchan can fix that by making clear that the risk of ignoring his rulings far outweighs any\xa0potential reward.\xa0Before Cohen testifies, Merchan should issue a stern reminder that any additional violations of the court’s evidentiary rulings will result in serious sanctions, not a slap on the wrist. He also should describe what the sanctions could be to put the Trump team on notice of the grave repercussions to disregarding the court’s rulings. Merchan must take all necessary and appropriate measures to protect the integrity of this trial from a criminal defendant hellbent on undermining our judicial system and a defense attorney who has lost all credibility with the court.</p></div></div></body></html>', "Judge Merchan needs to rein in Trump's hush money lawyer before it's too late", 'https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-lawyer-todd-blanche-hush-money-trial-rcna150376'}

The expected 2024 Latino voter turnout <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/higher-latino-voter-turnout-projected-2024-rcna138841" target="_blank">is currently at around 17.5 million</a>, which means that more than half of eligible Latino voters are persuadable.</p><p class="">As NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/young-latino-voters-candidates-2024-election-rcna147624" target="_blank">reported</a> this week, “In the western U.S., which includes the battlegrounds of Arizona and Nevada, Latinos are <a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/more-8-million-youth-are-newly-eligible-voters-2022" target="_blank">nearly 4 of every 10</a> newly eligible voters — defined as those who have reached ages 18 or 19 since the 2022 midterms. In the South, Latinos are 24% of newly eligible voters, and in the Northeast they make up 19%.”</p><p class="">With so much in play, local outreach and messaging will be crucial in the fight to win over new voters and possibly bring some Latino voters back into the Democratic fold, especially in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Although these states have <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/01/10/key-facts-about-hispanic-eligible-voters-in-2024/#detailed-data" target="_blank">Latino voter shares in the single digits</a> (anywhere from 4% to 6%), a consistent campaign presence could make enough of a difference to win a state’s electoral votes.</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">The Republican National Committee has cut back dramatically on community centers aimed at increasing Latino voter support.</p></div><p class="">Second, Republicans have had their own troubles with Latino outreach.

A story last Friday from The Keystone, a Pennsylvania-based outlet, <a href="https://keystonenewsroom.com/story/gop-latino-outreach-offices-missing-in-2024/" target="_blank">said</a> that while the Biden campaign opened up 10 offices across the state, “Republicans have been non-existent.” With the RNC’s closure of community centers, one former Allentown location is now a cash-checking store and another in Philadelphia is a child care center, the outlet reported.</p><p class="">In a statement to The Keystone, José Muñoz, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said, “While Democrats are trying to meaningfully and thoughtfully engage with these voters, Republicans are only interested in a publicity stunt.”</p><p class="">There are other indications that Democrats and Biden can still do well with Latino voters. The campaign <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/joe-biden-univision-enrique-acevedo" target="_blank">has reportedly made peace</a> with Spanish-language network Univision, after last year’s interview with Trump <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-univision-interview-latino-voters-division-rcna124466" target="_blank">caused friction</a>. The president’s interview with the network in April didn’t lead to any political disaster or fallout. In addition, while the April Axios/Ipsos poll conducted in partnership with Noticias Telemundo <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/latino-americans-arent-favorable-trump-or-biden-feel-democratic-party-better-represents-them" target="_blank">noted</a> that Biden’s approval ratings with Latinos were at just 41%, Trump’s rating came in at a dismal 32%. The same poll acknowledged that 36% of Latinos believed Democrats better represent them, compared to just 16% who felt the same way about Republicans.</p><p class="">The Biden camp also <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/21/biden-trump-hispanic-vote-2024-00153518" target="_blank">continues to tout</a> its Latino outreach efforts as coming earlier than in previous cycles. It knows it needs young Latino voters too, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/young-latino-voters-candidates-2024-election-rcna147624" target="_blank">so reports</a> that this segment of voters is disillusioned should be taken seriously.</p><p class="">“I think that Latino voters know how much is at stake, but there is an information gap. Our job on this campaign is to reach folks and connect the dots,” said Michelle Villegas, the Biden campaign Latino engagement director, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/21/biden-trump-hispanic-vote-2024-00153518" target="_blank">t</a><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/21/biden-trump-hispanic-vote-2024-00153518" target="_blank">o Politico in April</a>.</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">It’s premature to conclude that Democrats have lost the party’s edge with Latinos forever. </p></div><p class="">As a result, it does appear that the strategy of approaching Latino voters with swing-state resources could finally be hitting home with Democrats. As I said <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/05/931836707/how-latino-voters-broke-expectations-this-election" target="_blank">in a post-2020 election appearance on NPR</a> about Latino support and political parties, “[Latinos] represent different ideologies. We come from different backgrounds, different demographics, economic status — working class, you know, middle class, upper class. It’s changing. We’re white. We’re Black. We’re Indigenous. We’re mixed. Figure it out. It’s like — there’s no longer Hispanic media. It’s what it is. It’s like we’re swing states. That’s who we are.”</p><p class="">It’s premature to conclude that Democrats have lost the party’s edge with Latinos forever. Democratic-leaning Latino voters remain a key reason why states like California, New York and Illinois are consistently blue. But real work will need to happen in swing states, engaging Latinos there to provide just enough support to win.</p><p class="endmark">Fortunately for Democrats, it looks like the Biden campaign finally got the message.</p></div></div></body></html>'}

And while that is understandable from a practical perspective, it raises the question of why they keep pressing the issue.</p><p class="">Assistant District Attorney Christopher Conroy <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/live-blog/trump-trial-hush-money-case-live-updates-rcna149907/rcrd40609?canonicalCard=true" target="_blank">told Judge Juan Merchan on Thursday morning</a> that the office isn\'t seeking jail time "yet" because it prefers to minimize disruptions to the proceeding. Conroy made the remark at a hearing over the latest alleged violations of the gag order.</p><p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"></p><p class="">Merchan already found Trump in contempt on Tuesday for violating the order nine times. <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/judge-merchan-trump-gag-order-ruling-rcna148937" target="_blank">The judge imposed </a>a $1,000 fine for each violation — the legal maximum. Even Merchan effectively<strong> </strong>conceded the punishment was relatively minor, but in his ruling Tuesday, he warned Trump that he could send him to jail if he keeps testing the limit. </p><p class="">Ahead of Thursday’s hearing over additional alleged violations, <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-trial-gag-order-hearing-merchan-rcna150292" target="_blank">I wrote that</a> fines might be all that come out of this latest hearing, too. That’s because Merchan’s jail warning in Tuesday’s ruling might be read to apply only to violations that come after that ruling, and the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-trial-judge-hold-gag-order-hearing-stormy-daniels-ex-lawyer-take-rcna150240" target="_blank">alleged violations at issue in Thursday’s hearing</a> happened earlier. There’s no legal bar to Merchan jailing Trump over these latest alleged violations — he could’ve done so with the nine violations in Tuesday\'s ruling — because <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/JUD/751" target="_blank">state law</a> gives him the option of fines up to $1,000 and/or jail up to 30 days. </p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">Trump didn’t need any special warning, but Merchan gave him another one anyway.</p></div><p class="">Trump didn’t need any special warning, but Merchan gave him another one anyway, probably to delay the momentous decision of whether to jail a former president and presumptive presidential nominee.\xa0</p><p class="">But with the state’s latest concession Thursday, Merchan may not have to truly grapple yet with whether to send Trump to jail, since even prosecutors say they don\'t want that yet. That is, if the judge even finds any violations over the latest contested statements about witnesses Michael Cohen and David Pecker and the jury. Merchan didn’t immediately rule Thursday, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/live-blog/trump-trial-hush-money-case-live-updates-rcna149907" target="_blank">as testimony resumed</a> in the criminal case charging Trump with falsifying business records. (Trump has pleaded not guilty.)\xa0</p><p class="">Let’s assume Merchan only imposes fines again if he finds further violations. What does the prosecution’s position mean for the additional violations by Trump that will almost surely come? Prosecutors said they’re not seeking jail <em>yet</em>, implying there may come a point when they will. And by their logic, jailing Trump risks disrupting the trial. Maybe so.\xa0</p><p class="">But that raises the question of the purpose of the gag order in the first place. It\'s to <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-gag-order-hush-money-trial-new-york-rcna145171" target="_blank">protect the proceedings</a>, by stopping Trump <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24528528/dec-and-order-re-clarification-of-order-restricting-extrajudicial-statements-4-1-24.pdf" target="_blank">from going after</a> witnesses, jurors and others involved in the case (he can still rail against the judge and Manhattan District Attorney <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-gag-order-hush-money-trial-rcna140558" target="_blank">Alvin Bragg</a> himself). The prosecution seems to think that’s an important interest to protect because they keep raising it with Merchan. But if Trump keeps violating the order in the face of $1,000 fines, it’s clear that the order isn’t serving its purpose.</p><p class="">Prosecutors likely don’t want to risk messing up the underlying case itself, which <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-trial-access-hollywood-tape-rcna150210" target="_blank">seems to be moving along well for them</a>.

{'<html><body><div><div class="article-body__content"><p class="">Late last week, the Biden administration announced it had finalized federal rules protecting trans people from discrimination in health care facilities. It’s the latest move the White House has taken to try to stem the <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/anti-lgbtq-bills-supreme-court-astroturfing-rcna135500" target="_blank">relentless attacks on access to gender-affirming care</a> by red-state legislatures over the last few years.</p><p class="">The rule resets Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, which protects patients from discrimination based on sex, to include gender identity. President Joe Biden’s version of the rule returns the protections to what they were when the law was <a href="https://time.com/4329609/transgender-discrimination-obamacare-healthcare/" target="_blank">initially implemented</a> by the Obama administration in 2016. The restored rule brings the landmark health care law in alignment with how the conservative Supreme Court defined sex discrimination in <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/civil-liberties/how-the-impact-of-bostock-v-clayton-county-on-lgbtq-rights-continues-to-expand" target="_blank">Bostock v. Clayton County</a>, a 2020 ruling that banned employment discrimination against LGBTQ people.</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">The 2024 US Trans Survey showed that 24% of all trans people did not see a doctor when they needed to in the last 12 months due to fear of mistreatment.</p></div><p class="">Biden’s decision is a small but important step in the fight back against the onslaught of right-wing attacks in conservative state legislatures. But it’s a far cry from the guaranteed protections trans people need.</p><p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"></p><p class="">In 2018, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/22/us/transgender-reaction-rally.html" target="_blank">finalized its own rule</a> to define sex as sex assigned at birth, ostensibly legalizing discrimination against trans people by medical providers. The <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/hallie-jackson/watch/biden-administration-reverses-trump-policy-that-limited-transgender-health-care-protections-111638597608" target="_blank">back-and-forth</a> between successive Democratic and Republican presidencies has left trans people in legal limbo on the federal level as the national political rhetoric against us has ramped up to extremes over recent years.</p><p class="">The renewed rule gives Biden’s Health and Human Services agency more leverage to punish health care providers and state health policies that discriminate against trans people. It also gives the agency and plaintiffs in federal lawsuits an additional basis to sue states over bans on gender-affirming care.</p><p class="">But because it’s a federal rule only defining how the executive branch enforces the law, it is subject to the whims of whoever controls the White House.</p><p class="">To be sure, if Trump is re-elected this fall, the rule will flip back toward once again allowing discrimination, throwing trans access to good health care back into chaos and to the whims of potentially bigoted doctors. The <a href="https://ustranssurvey.org/report/health/" target="_blank">2024 U.S. Trans Survey</a> showed that 24% of all trans people did not see a doctor when they needed to in the last 12 months due to fear of mistreatment.</p><p class="">Unfortunately for trans people in the U.S., there’s little hope of a permanent solution anytime soon. It’s unlikely that legislation laying out a specific definition for the law would pass Congress as long as <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/04/25/senate-republicans-filibuster-trump" target="_blank">the Senate filibuster</a> remains in place. It’s much more likely that a permanent solution will come through the federal court system.</p><p class="">With the congressional branch essentially paralyzed by the filibuster, so many permanent policy solutions have come from the Supreme Court, and the definition of sex under the Affordable Care Act is probably no different.</p><p class="">There is currently a circuit split on the issue, with the 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals refusing to use the Bostock definition of sex while <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/obamacare-lgbtq-discrimination-clause-could-cause-circuit-split" target="_blank">several other federal circuits</a> have ruled that trans people are protected under the law. The Supreme Court is more likely to hear a future case if different circuits disagree.</p><p class="">That’s a scary proposition for trans people, as the court is overwhelmingly conservative, and a ruling against protections could have far-reaching implications both in and out of doctor’s offices. A fresh case could even allow the court’s more conservative members to overturn the Bostock decision and breathe new life into <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/cpac-speaker-transgender-people-eradicated-1234690924/" target="_blank">conservative plans to “eradicate” trans people from public life</a>.</p><p class="">All of this comes as conservatives’ legislative will to persecute trans people has relatively waned of late. Several recent news reports have shown that state-level Republican legislators <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/04/29/lgbtq-legislation-trans-bills/" target="_blank">have cooled to the idea</a> of passing more anti-trans laws, especially in an important election year. Numerous polls have shown that voters generally don’t care about trans issues, and instead tend to focus on the economy, immigration and crime, prompting Republicans to dial back their legislative attacks on trans people this year.</p><p class="">Historically, appetites for anti-LGBTQ lawmaking have ebbed and flowed. Bans on gay marriage hit a high point around the 2004 presidential election, before somewhat cooling off as a deeper media debate fossilized and court cases began to make their way through the judicial system. We’re likely to see a similar trajectory with anti-trans laws, though it would be wise to watch how Republicans approach trans issues once this election year is out of the way.</p><p class="endmark">Until Congress, or much more likely the Supreme Court, decides whether we are worthy of having the same right not to be discriminated against as everyone else, trans people are left at the mercy of the office of the presidency. That makes the 2024 presidential election, and every federal election thereafter, very important for U.S. trans people until a permanent solution is rendered — or until Republicans back off their obsession with trans bodies.</p></div></div></body></html>', 'https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-trump-transgender-health-care-rcna150270', 'Biden just left access to trans health care vulnerable to Trump’s whims'}

Take yesterday, for example.</p><p class="">“Everything that we do in the House of Representatives should be in the best interests of getting Donald Trump re-elected,” Nehls said — while wearing a necktie featuring images of the former president.</p><p class="">In general, elected lawmakers tend to say that <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/key-republican-goal-2024-denying-biden-election-year-wins-rcna149980" target="_blank">everything Congress does</a> should be in the best interests of the American public, but the Texan apparently didn’t feel the need to maintain the pretense. As Nehls described it, the <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/republicans-congress-biden-trump-2024-rcna136773" target="_blank">House of Representatives</a> shouldn’t necessarily serve as part of a powerful branch of government. Rather, the House is effectively a super PAC, looking out for the interests of a twice-impeached suspected felon.</p><p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"></p><p class="">The comments led Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. to <a href="https://twitter.com/BillPascrell/status/1786019781176406241" target="_blank">respond online</a> soon after, “Elected Republicans think their #1 job in office is helping Donald Trump. Not aiding the people, not protecting America, serving Trump. The Republican Party is unfit to govern America and doesn’t give a damn about you.”</p><p class="">What’s interesting about Nehls, however, is his indifference to appearances. The GOP congressman apparently realizes that he looks more like a sycophantic Trump superfan and less like an elected federal lawmaker, but he just doesn’t seem to care.</p><p class="">This is, for example, the same Nehls <a href="https://politicalwire.com/2024/04/15/bonus-quote-of-the-day-1979/" target="_blank">who said</a> a few weeks ago that he supports extending his party’s <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/fresh-evidence-republicans-tax-breaks-didnt-pay-rcna141882" target="_blank">failed 2017 tax cuts</a> because, “Trump is right all the time. Trump is right all the time.” A few days prior, Nehls <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/10/politics/trump-johnson-news-conference/index.html" target="_blank">also said</a> that House Speaker Mike Johnson should be “consulting with Donald Trump on just about everything we do.”</p><p class="">The month before that, Nehls attended President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/state-union-key-takeaways-biden-address-rcna140768" target="_blank">while wearing a T-shirt featuring Trump’s mugshot</a>.</p><p class="">But perhaps most notable of all is the fact that the Texas Republican has reinforced his reputation as The King of Saying the Quiet Part Out Loud. In January, for example, <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/border-policies-gops-nehls-says-quiet-part-loud-rcna132223" target="_blank">Nehls said</a> he wanted to derail a bipartisan border bill because it might “help Joe Biden’s approval rating.”</p><p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"></p><p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"></p><p class="">It <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/border-policies-gops-nehls-says-quiet-part-loud-rcna132223" target="_blank">wasn’t an isolated incident</a>.

{'<html><body><div><div class="article-body__content"><p class="">The potential for a fresh round of chaos has lingered over Washington for weeks now, as conservatives have seethed over Speaker Mike Johnson’s willingness to rely on Democratic votes to prevent paralysis in the House.

But their decision to publicly back Johnson, R-La., on Tuesday and the timing of their declaration show exactly the sort of long-term strategic thinking that Greene has struggled with. As it turns out, her choice to follow through on her threat is a major boost to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and his leverage over the House’s proceedings.</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">It may seem downright bizarre that Democratic leaders would put out a statement pledging to defend a Republican speaker.</p></div><p class="">The catalyst for the latest tempest is last month’s series of votes to finally get a Ukraine aid package through the House. Greene had warned Johnson that this would be a red line for her, filing what’s known as a “motion to vacate” in March. She followed that up with a <a href="https://twitter.com/RepMTG/status/1777687606416859496" target="_blank">five-page letter</a> ripping into Johnson that <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/marjorie-taylor-greene-house-speaker-mike-johnson-republicans-rcna147104" target="_blank">my colleague Zeeshan Aleem</a> described as “more about her burnishing her credentials as a MAGA mutineer than it is about critiquing Johnson in a productive manner.”</p><p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"></p><p class="">Greene’s warnings went unheeded —\xa0and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/marjorie-taylor-greene-struggles-find-gop-support-deposing-mike-johnso-rcna149965" target="_blank">unsupported</a>, it turns out. <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/three-gosar-joins-effort-oust-gop-speaker-rcna148596" target="_blank">Only two co-sponsors</a> have signed on to her motion. To be fair, that is more than initially put their names to the motion that removed Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., in October. But there’s been little appetite from <a href="https://punchbowl.news/archive/43024-punchbowl-news-am/" target="_blank">even the usually pugnacious House Freedom Caucus</a> to back Greene’s play.</p><p class="">But even if more of the GOP’s far right wanted to oust Johnson, Democrats would still have to provide the bulk of the votes against him. Until this week, they kept their powder dry on what they’d do if Greene followed through on her threats. While <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/moderate-democrats-say-help-mike-johnson-keep-job-speaker-rcna133711" target="_blank">some moderates had indicated</a> they might be willing to support Johnson, officially the caucus was waiting for Jeffries to call the play. That was the case last year, as well, as McCarthy faced down a potential coup from a small band of GOP upstarts. It was Jeffries who made the call to have his members vote against McCarthy, alongside just eight Republicans, <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/maga-republicans-kevin-mccarthy-house-achievements-rcna144976" target="_blank">guaranteeing his removal</a>.</p><p class="">McCarthy sealed his fate with a record of reneging on deals that earned him Democrats’ ire. In contrast, Johnson has been square in his dealings, even if it <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/mike-johnson-democracy-house-votes-israel-ukraine-aid-rcna148067" target="_blank">took longer than many preferred</a> for him to pass the foreign aid package. Still, Jeffries took even House Democrats by surprise with how quickly the leadership team issued a statement of support for Johnson after a closed-door caucus meeting Tuesday. “At this moment, upon completion of our national security work, the time has come to turn the page on this chapter of Pro-Putin Republican obstruction,” <a href="https://jeffries.house.gov/2024/04/30/joint-democratic-leadership-statement-on-motion-to-vacate/" target="_blank">the statement concluded</a>. “We will vote to table Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s Motion to Vacate the Chair. If she invokes the motion, it will not succeed.”</p><p class="">The move seems to have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/01/marjorie-taylor-greene-motion-to-vacate-house-speaker-mike-johnson/" target="_blank">incensed Greene</a> enough for her to finally act. She accused Johnson of cutting a “slimy backroom deal” with Democrats to remain in power. Johnson, for his part, seemed unaware of the show of support, which was released as he was in the middle of a news conference, and he insisted that no deal had been made. But even with the new <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/30/marjorie-taylor-greene-bid-topple-johnson-veers-self-sabotage-00155286" target="_blank">Republican National Committee chair</a>, Michael Whatley, reportedly urging her not to proceed, Greene vowed to press forward.</p><p class="">“Now we have Hakeem Jeffries and the Democrats coming out, embracing Mike Johnson with a warm hug and a big, wet, sloppy kiss,” Greene said Wednesday. “Why? Because Mike Johnson is giving them everything they want.” That’s a bit of an exaggeration of where Democrats are coming from. They know that the current speaker isn’t a long-term ally. If anything, the decision to back Johnson now had the effect of drawing Greene into a battle she can’t win.</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">If anything, the decision to back Johnson now had the effect of drawing Greene into a battle she can’t win.</p></div><p class="">In the short term, the play from Democrats could easily have been to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siOF8r0tVl4" target="_blank">let them fight</a>, basking in the chaos among their enemies. After all, there’s nothing on the legislative calendar over the summer that stands a chance of getting through both houses of Congress that demands immediate attention. Democrats could have simply chosen to be absent for any vote, leaving it to Johnson to ensure he has a majority of the GOP caucus on his side. It would embarrass Greene if <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/30/marjorie-taylor-greene-bid-topple-johnson-veers-self-sabotage-00155286" target="_blank">her fellow MAGA die-hards rallied to support him</a> despite his supposed betrayal, and, should she somehow succeed, three more speaker-less weeks would only bolster the message that Republicans can’t be trusted to govern.</p><p class="">But there’s more than altruism at work here from Democrats. In pledging their votes to table Greene’s motion, they’ve managed to <a href="https://twitter.com/HouseInSession/status/1785359183837012444" target="_blank">free up </a><a href="https://twitter.com/HouseInSession/status/1785359183837012444" target="_blank"><em>more </em></a><a href="https://twitter.com/HouseInSession/status/1785359183837012444" target="_blank">Republicans</a> who want to show their displeasure with Johnson to do so without consequences. That, in turn, will highlight once more <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/mike-johnson-house-republican-majority-rcna147849" target="_blank">how little he’d be able to get done without the minority party</a> between now and November. That matters because government funding for this current fiscal year — which was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-senate-shutdown-vote-rcna144440" target="_blank">approved only in March</a> thanks to the GOP’s chaos — runs dry in September. By keeping Johnson in place now and the appropriations process moving through the summer, Democrats will have more of a hand in preventing the kind of deep cuts that conservatives have demanded.</p><p class="endmark">I can imagine that Greene and other arch-conservatives might urge Johnson to hold out on shepherding spending bills that Senate Democrats and President Joe Biden can support through the House, in the hopes of a massive GOP win in the fall. But nobody who actually cares about winning or keeping a majority wants to be the reason for a federal shutdown right before Election Day. It will most likely fall on Democrats once again to <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/house-speaker-mike-johnson-prevent-shutdown-democrats-rcna125220" target="_blank">save Johnson from his own caucus</a> in that case. If that’s the case, it’ll be yet another addition to the debt that Greene’s latest stunt has only increased — and one that Jeffries will make sure Johnson pays.</p></div></div></body></html>', 'Why Democrats made a bizarre pledge to defend Mike Johnson', 'https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/house-democrats-mike-johnson-marjorie-taylor-greene-rcna149789'}

On Tuesday afternoon, as prosecutor Joshua Steinglass led witness Keith Davidson, a lawyer who once represented Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, through a series of text messages, emails and contractual agreements related to the Daniels hush money payoff, I witnessed Eric looking not at Davidson or Steinglass, but up at a monitor to his left on which the evidence was displayed.

That designation places it in the most strictly regulated category of drugs under federal rules, and <a href="https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/Marijuana-Cannabis-2020_0.pdf" target="_blank">means</a> that a drug has “high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision.” Marijuana’s Schedule I classification puts it in the same class of drugs as heroin.</p><p class="">The Biden administration will finally be putting an end to this ludicrous designation, according to four sources with knowledge of the decision who <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/biden-administration-plans-reclassify-marijuana-easing-restrictions-na-rcna149424" target="_blank">tell NBC News</a> that the Drug Enforcement Administration is expected to reclassify marijuana as a Schedule III drug. That category is far less strictly regulated, and it acknowledges a drug’s potential medical utility. It places marijuana in the same category as drugs such as steroids and Tylenol with codeine.</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">It speaks to how much attitudes toward marijuana have changed in the U.S. in recent years that this change could be a political win for Biden.</p></div><p class="">This move is way, way overdue, but I’ll take it. It’s a rare moment of rational drug policy at the federal level, and it should help pave the path for safer, more informed marijuana use. It speaks to how much attitudes toward marijuana have changed in the U.S. in recent years and could be a political win for Biden.</p><p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"></p><p class="">The Biden administration’s expected reclassification of marijuana will have a major impact on the status of the drug in the U.S. Due to its Schedule I classification, marijuana has been <a href="https://healthsciences.arizona.edu/news/stories/should-cannabis-still-be-schedule-i-drug" target="_blank">extremely difficult to study</a>. The restrictions were justified in part by the absurd circular reasoning of Schedule I classification: since marijuana is officially deemed medically useless, <a href="https://healthsciences.arizona.edu/news/stories/should-cannabis-still-be-schedule-i-drug" target="_blank">the high regulatory bar</a> for research has blocked the capacity of scientists to ascertain many of its medical benefits. Given that marijuana has already been legalized or made available for medical purposes in many states, we desperately need more science-backed information about safe usage, short-term risks and long-term risks as legalization <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/today/2022/11/04/decade-after-legalizing-cannabis-colorado-heres-what-weve-learned" target="_blank">increases usage</a>. (Marijuana is far, far safer than commonly depicted in the reactionary war on drugs hysteria — <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/can-you-die-from-marijuana-thc-overdose-2022-11" target="_blank">no adult has ever overdosed on the drug</a>, for example — but that doesn’t mean its effects on cognition, motor skills, lung health, mental health and so on should not be studied extensively.) Now it will finally be easier to conduct research on the drug.</p><p class="">As NBC News reports, the rescheduling of marijuana also means “opening the door for pharmaceutical companies to get involved with the sale and distribution of medical marijuana in states where it is legal.” That could mean far more sophisticated medical marijuana products will emerge in the future.</p><p class="">And the reclassification will also help reshape the legal market for marijuana. Currently, marijuana businesses are limited in their ability to make ordinary tax deductions because of the Schedule I classification. The reclassification will remove that restriction, meaning that marijuana businesses will be able to reduce their tax burden and operate more nimbly. That, in turn, could make them more competitive against black market operators.</p><p class="">Some 20 years ago, a Democratic president rescheduling marijuana would’ve been received as a radical policy decision. Republicans — and many Democrats — would\'ve hammered the president for being soft in the war on drugs and poisoning America’s youth.\xa0</p><p class="endmark">Today, the rescheduling of marijuana looks overdue and reasonable — and likely consistutes a minor political win. Polling indicates an <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/03/26/most-americans-favor-legalizing-marijuana-for-medical-recreational-use" target="_blank">overwhelming majority of Americans favor the legalization of marijuana for recreational or medical use</a>, and this step is more modest than federal legalization. It marks an incremental acknowledgment that marijuana isn’t the hard-core drug it’s been vilified as, opens up the path for understanding more of its medical benefits, and improves the business climate for a burgeoning industry. Marijuana policy isn\'t a top tier issue for the public these days, but Biden\'s move is still likely to register with many as sensible, and a reminder of how drug policy is growing more serious in this country, even if at a glacial pace.</p></div></div></body></html>', "Biden's effort to reclassify marijuana is a smart move"}
{'<html><body><div><div class="article-body__content"><p class="">Figuring out what a second term for Donald Trump would mean for reproductive rights hasn’t been easy. He began with implausible and cryptic promises to make a <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-pulse/2024/04/08/trump-hunting-a-deal-on-abortion-00150981" target="_blank">deal on abortion</a> that would lead to “peace on that issue,” then flirted with endorsing a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/us/politics/trump-15-week-federal-abortion-ban.html" target="_blank">15-week ban</a>. More recently, the former president pivoted again, suggesting that a single idea encompassed his thinking on the issue: <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-says-abortion-restrictions-left-states-dodging-national-ban-rcna146309" target="_blank">states’ rights</a>, letting red states do what they liked but doing nothing to criminalize abortion at the federal level.</p><p class="">But in a wide-ranging recent interview with <a href="https://time.com/6972022/donald-trump-transcript-2024-election/" target="_blank">Time magazine,</a> he provided the most revealing glimpse yet of where he actually stands — both in what he was willing to say and what remained unspoken. First, he seems to have <em>no </em>position on state-level restrictions, no matter how extreme. Second, and just as important, he still stubbornly refused to say anything at all when it comes to reviving the Comstock Act, a 19th-century obscenity law, <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/arizona-abortion-ban-zombie-laws-rcna147850" target="_blank">as an abortion ban</a>. It seems he wants to obscure his stance until it is too late for voters to decide what to make of his position.</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">It seems dystopian — and difficult — for states to effectively monitor every single person who could become pregnant.</p></div><p class="">Trump’s interview first makes clear that his idea of states’ rights is a kind of no-holds barred reality in conservative states. When pressed about whether states could surveil every pregnancy within its borders, he responded in the affirmative. When asked whether states could choose to punish women, he saw no reason that they couldn’t.</p><p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"></p><p class="">Some of these hypotheticals may never come to pass. It seems dystopian — and difficult — for states to effectively monitor every single person who could become pregnant. Even laws punishing abortion seekers — which are now being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/01/us/abortion-abolitionists.html" target="_blank">championed by so-called “abolitionists”</a> — seem unlikely to pass in the near term. Leading antiabortion groups reject them, even as abolitionists argue that anything less but punishing women cannot be reconciled with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/01/us/abortion-abolitionists.html" target="_blank">idea of fetal personhood</a>. What is revealing about Trump’s answer is that as far as red states are concerned, he thinks anything goes.</p><p class="">That hardly means Trump will leave it to states to set their own policies. Trump’s interviewer, Time reporter Eric Cortellessa, asked the former president whether he agreed with the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/431" target="_blank">Life at Conception Act</a>, a personhood-adjacent bill sponsored by some of the most antiabortion members of Congress. When Trump repeated that “I’m leaving everything up to the states,” Cortellessa asked him whether he would veto such a measure if it landed on his desk. Trump refused to answer the question, insisting that such a bill would never get through Congress.</p><p class="">That diagnosis seems correct, but Cortellessa pointed out that for months, veterans of the first Trump administration have promised that the former president would transform the Comstock Act, an 1873 obscenity law that is already on the books, into a de facto ban on all abortions. A coalition of more than 100 conservative groups <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf" target="_blank">espoused this theory</a>, contending that the Comstock Act makes it a crime to send or receive information, pills or paraphernalia related to abortion in the mail.</p><p class="">This argument overrides nearly a century of <a href="https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=823120105064096070015099110067021109052085065093048051024024071074117103066098015028020016099038123036046077014084071095071093025090034086038099113084090004095015054089003003101105120027064086125106009116077118119097126094089072018122088121115081064&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;INDEX=TRUE" target="_blank">federal precedent</a>, but it appears to have already convinced Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, who echoed these ideas about Comstock in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/03/26/comstock-act-supreme-court-abortion-pill/" target="_blank">recent oral arguments</a> in a case involving mifepristone, a drug used in more than half of U.S. abortions. To make the Comstock strategy work, antiabortion leaders would not need to convince voters or even Congress. They would need to persuade the Supreme Court’s conservative supermajority to accept their interpretation of Comstock — and would need a Trump Justice Department to enforce it.</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">It’s not hard to see why Trump prefers to hide behind the states and avoid questions about a Comstock-based ban.</p></div><p class="">Trump has dodged questions about the Comstock Act for months. In the first part of his interview with Time, conducted April 12, he pledged to issue a major statement about it within the next two weeks. That, of course, was more than two weeks ago. In the second part, conducted Saturday, Trump swore that his announcement would come “over the next week or two.”</p><p class="">It’s not hard to see why Trump prefers to hide behind the states and avoid questions about a Comstock-based ban. If a state decides to recognize fetal personhood (and thereby functionally prohibit IVF), Trump can disclaim responsibility. Meanwhile, his campaign has been having it both ways with Comstock. While the former president beats the drum about states’ rights, his allies and proxies promise antiabortion voters that he will give them the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/17/us/politics/trump-allies-abortion-restrictions.html" target="_blank">abortion ban</a> they have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/05/trump-abortion/" target="_blank">always wanted.</a></p><p class="endmark">Trump may never issue that statement about the Comstock Act, but it is clear that some voters have fundamentally misunderstood what he will do if he wins a second term. He cannot both enforce the Comstock Act against doctors, patients and drug companies in progressive states and keep the federal government out of the abortion issue. But if his campaign is successful, we will not find out which road he plans to take until after he is sworn into office — when it’s already too late.</p></div></div></body></html>', 'https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-abortion-stance-2024-election-rcna150211', 'Trump wants to run out the clock on abortion'}

The United Methodist Church is the largest <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2015/05/12/appendix-b-classification-of-protestant-denominations/" target="_blank">mainline Protestant denomination</a> in the country, with <a href="https://www.umdata.org/" target="_blank">5,424,043 members and 29,746 active churches </a> as of 2022.\xa0\xa0</p><p class="">The Methodist change of church policy is an important moment in the broader cultural shift toward LGBTQ acceptance and affirmation. We can put to rest the idea that religion and LGBTQ rights are inherently in conflict. Just as positive views on LGBTQ rights have trended upward, so, too, have Christian groups evolved their theological understandings of human sexuality and gender identity. In the process, more and more churches have embraced a more expansive view of human dignity.</p><p class="">Unsure whether the “God vs. Gays” narrative is outdated? I invite you to visit your local Pride parade this June and count the number of churches marching in the street.\xa0</p><p class="">The UMC vote is the latest in a wave of good news for LGBTQ Christians as more and more churches change their policies. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Episcopal Church and the Presbyterian Church USA, the nation\'s second-, third- and fourth-largest mainline Protestant denominations, have all taken pro-LGBTQ steps in recent years. Pope Francis has moved the Catholic Church in a positive direction, <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/pope-francis-same-sex-blessing-rcna130276" target="_blank">allowing priests to bless same-sex couples</a>.\xa0</p><p class="">And whether or not their official teachings condone homosexuality, Christians in the pews favor LGBTQ rights.

South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who died in 2021, was one of the fiercest advocates. “<a href="https://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20211231-south-africa-s-lgbtq-community-hails-rainbow-warrior-desmond-tutu" target="_blank">I would not worship a God who is homophobic</a>,” he once said. “I would refuse to go to a homophobic heaven. No, I would say, ‘Sorry, I would much rather go to the other place.’”</p><p class="">Some parts of the United Methodist Church didn’t wait for the discriminatory language to be removed to start treating LGBTQ Methodists with dignity. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/pride50-karen-oliveto-united-methodist-church-s-first-lesbian-bishop-n1007956" target="_blank">The Rev. Karen Oliveto became the first openly LGBTQ bishop in the denomination</a> in 2016. “<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/first-openly-gay-united-methodist-bishop-karen-oliveto-pride/" target="_blank">As I bring my full self into spaces, it invites others, no matter who they are, to be more authentic</a>,” Oliveto told CBS News. “To have people who are powerful role models can change everything.”</p><p class="">I wish I’d had Bishop Oliveto as a role model when I was growing up Methodist. My mom and I attended the 2016 meeting of the General Conference in Portland, Oregon. I was in seminary and hoping the denomination would remove the harmful language then. It didn’t, and I left in search of a church outside the UMC that didn’t discriminate. I’m still connected to the UMC, though, as a student in the doctor of ministry program at one of its seminaries, Iliff School of Theology in Denver.</p><p class="">While I left the UMC because of the discriminatory language, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/1-5-united-methodist-congregations-us-left-lgbtq-conflicts-rcna92853" target="_blank">some churches have left recently</a> out of a concern that those “self-avowed practicing homosexuals” weren’t being sufficiently punished. The formerly UMC anti-LGBTQ congregations have dominated news coverage of the UMC vote for LGBTQ equality.\xa0</p><p class="">It\'s sad that these disaffiliations have dominated news coverage. Yes, some Christians are anti-LGBTQ. That’s not noteworthy, and it\'s certainly not the main story here. The lifting of the ban is the story.

The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/us/mississippi-medicaid-expansion.html" target="_blank">reported</a>:</p><section class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote__quote"><p>Mississippi lawmakers reached an agreement late Monday on a proposal to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, providing largely free health coverage to an additional 200,000 low-income residents in a state with dire health outcomes and numerous rural hospitals facing financial collapse. ... The agreement represents a breakthrough for Mississippi, where a coalition of hospital leaders, the broader business community, religious groups and a bipartisan bloc of elected officials have pressed lawmakers to join the 40 other states that have expanded Medicaid over the past decade.</p><p></p><small class="blockquote__source"><span></span></small></blockquote></section><p class="">Yes, Mississippi is a reliably “red” state. And yes, Republicans continue to control all of the levers of power, including sizable majorities in the state House and state Senate.</p><p class="">But on this issue, after years in which the state’s health system has struggled and hospitals have <a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2023/07/24/mississippi-rural-hospitals-new-report/" target="_blank">struggled to keep their doors open</a>, there’s newfound interest in making this progressive change.</p><p class="">Circling back to our <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/medicaid-expansion-unexpectedly-move-mississippi-rcna141658" target="_blank">recent coverage</a>, there was an unexpected breakthrough in February, when the GOP-led state House passed a Medicaid expansion bill with surprising ease — 98 to 20 — thanks in part to support from Jason White, Mississippi’s Republican state House speaker who championed the effort.</p><p class="">Republican Gov. Tate Reeves remained a fierce opponent of the idea — his reasoning has never made a lot of sense — but given the veto-proof margin in the state House, it didn’t much matter.</p><p class="">What did matter, however, was skepticism from the GOP-led state Senate, which preferred <a href="https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/politics/2024/03/27/ms-senate-considering-medicaid-expansion-but-will-help-fewer-people/73116037007/" target="_blank">a far more conservative approach</a> to the policy. Republican state senators in Mississippi were open to the possibility of accepting Medicaid expansion, but they wanted a less generous policy <a href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/40893/senate-medicaid-expansion-plan-could-cost-state-more-to-cover-fewer-people" target="_blank">that helped fewer people</a>.</p><p class="">Bicameral negotiations began, resulting in a bill that would, if approved, extend coverage to people with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level (roughly $20,000 a year for an individual), though Mississippians would have to work 100 hours a month to be eligible.</p><p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"></p><p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"></p><p class="">Success is by no means a sure thing. The compromise will still need to clear both chambers and probably overcome a gubernatorial veto. Just as importantly, as the Mississippi Free Press <a href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/41740/medicaid-expansion-compromise-plan-with-no-guarantee-of-expanded-care-will-get-a-vote" target="_blank">noted</a>, it will be up to the Biden administration to approve the onerous and unnecessary work requirements in this proposal — and the Democratic administration has already rejected similar efforts in other states.</p><p class="">All of which is to say, there’s been an unexpected breakthrough in Mississippi, and that’s encouraging, but there are some difficult hurdles between here and the finish line.</p><p class="">As for how we arrived at this point, when the U.S. Supreme Court initially upheld the Affordable Care Act’s constitutionality, the court’s majority delivered some bad news to health care advocates: Medicaid expansion, the justices concluded, had to be optional, not mandatory under federal law.</p><p class="">In policy circles, many assumed this wouldn’t be too big a deal. After all, they thought, states would obviously want to do the right thing — not only for its low-income citizens, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/28/us/politics/mississippi-medicaid-hospitals.html" target="_blank">but also for its hospitals</a> and state budgets. There are plenty of far-right ideologues and Republicans at the state level, the assumption held at the time, but they could do arithmetic. No state would choose to be so foolish as to voluntarily reject Medicaid expansion, right?</p><p class="">As things stand, 10 states have done exactly that — though there’s reason to believe that number might yet shrink.

On Thursday morning, the judge <a href="https://x.com/KatiePhang/status/1785407735984517591" target="_blank">will hold another contempt hearing</a> for additional alleged violations of the original order.</p><p class="">In many respects, Wednesday’s order wasn’t a surprise — attorneys and legal scholars across the ideological spectrum, a former <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/news/ex-trump-attorney-tells-cnn-new-trump-rant-to-local-news-a-direct-violation-of-gag-order/" target="_blank">Trump lawyer included</a>, expected Merchan to find Trump in direct violation of the order.

If Donald Trump continues to show contempt for the judge’s order and say what the judge tells him that he can’t say, then he needs to face the consequences just like you or I would if we were criminal defendants. Judge Merchan should order Trump’s detention as he would order the detention of anyone else who repeatedly violated what Merchan called his “lawful and unambiguous” order.</p><p class="">Sure, the judge’s putting Trump in jail would be likely to further galvanize his base in the short term. It would also be likely to galvanize Democrats, many of whom may believe that Trump should <em>already</em> be incarcerated for his efforts to subvert American democracy.</p><p class="">But Judge Merchan must not be motivated by any of these political considerations or driven by the plausible claim that he is being baited by Trump, who recently <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/06/trump-being-jailed-for-gag-order-violation-would-be-great-honor.html" target="_blank">posted</a> that if Merchan jailed him for violating the gag order, he would be a “Modern Day Nelson Mandela.” Prosecutor Chris Conroy said during an April 23 hearing that Trump\xa0“seems to be angling” to be locked up so he could capitalize on it politically.</p><p class="">Merchan’s sole job is to administer justice fairly without fear or favor. Incarceration — perhaps one night in jail for each new violation — should be a last resort, but it must remain on the table. </p><p class="">The judge acknowledged that fining Trump a total of $9,000 may not have a much of a deterrent effect, given the defendant’s great wealth, and he said he would prefer increasingly larger fines to locking the former president up. But he said he must consider “whether in some instances, jail may be a necessary punishment.”</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">Prosecutor Chris Conroy said during an April 23 hearing that Trump “seems to be angling” to be locked up so he could capitalize on it politically.</p></div><p class="">When Judge Merchan considers the handful of additional alleged violations on Thursday, he should reiterate this consequence and that Trump, and Trump alone, is responsible for whether or not he spends time in jail for blatant and repeated violations of court rules.</p><p class="">Perhaps this is an academic discussion, as there are signs that the Trump team and allies are broadening their approach and that <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/04/24/trump-allies-hush-money-prosecutor" target="_blank">surrogates</a> are picking up the mantle on his many false claims.

He also has no idea how tariffs work or what function they perform and doesn’t understand how his proposed policies would pile higher costs on American consumers already frustrated with rising inflation. That’s why it’s confounding that voters somehow <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/21/biden-tariffs-jobs-trump-inflation-nbc-news-poll.html" target="_blank">trust Trump</a> to bring down prices.</p><p class="">Trump’s latest love letter to tariffs came early in a lengthy interview with Time magazine reporter Eric Cortellessa. For months now, he’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/08/22/trump-trade-tariffs/" target="_blank">floated a potential 10% tariff</a> across the board on all imports.\xa0In other words, companies that are importing goods from places like Mexico or China would need to pay 10% of their cost to the U.S. Treasury Department. Now, though, he says the actual amount under his watch could be even higher:</p><section class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote__quote"><p>Cortellessa: When you say more than that, though: You mean maybe more than 10% on all imports?</p><p>Trump: More than 10%, yeah. I call it a ring around the country. We have a ring around the country. A reciprocal tax also, in addition to what we said. And if we do that, the numbers are staggering. I don’t believe it will have much of an effect because they’re making so much money off of us. I also don’t believe that the costs will go up that much. And a lot of people say, “Oh, that’s gonna be a tax on us.” I don’t believe that. I think it’s a tax on the country that’s doing it. And I know.</p><small class="blockquote__source"><span></span></small></blockquote></section><p class="">No, he doesn’t know, which is truly impressive for someone who has arguably been in charge of U.S. economic policy. Contrary to his long-standing belief, tariffs are <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/blog/who-really-pays-tariffs/" target="_blank">paid by the importers</a> as the goods enter the U.S., not by the exporting country. As <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-tariffs-inflation-biden-economy-rcna142837" target="_blank">my colleague Ryan Teague Beckwith noted</a> last month, the choices that American businesses presented with such a steep tariff would face are clear: “What are you going to do: pay the cost out of your own coffers, hurting the company’s bottom line, angering shareholders and possibly losing your job as a result? Or just raise prices 10% to cover the cost?” The answer is the latter, bumping up prices that have already risen sharply in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"></p><p class="">Cortellessa tried to press Trump about whether he’s comfortable with <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/24137666/trump-agenda-inflation-prices-dollar-devaluation-tariffs" target="_blank">the inflation that w</a><a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/24137666/trump-agenda-inflation-prices-dollar-devaluation-tariffs" target="_blank">ould</a><a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/24137666/trump-agenda-inflation-prices-dollar-devaluation-tariffs" target="_blank"> come with those tariff increases</a>, something Trump denied would happen before pivoting off into a semi-related tirade. The reporter tried again, asking directly whether he thinks businesses would pass on the costs to consumers.\xa0“No, I think what happens is you build,” Trump responded. “What happens to get out of the whole situation is you end up building, instead of having your product brought in from China, because of that additional cost, you end up making the product in the United States.” </p><p class="">That’s probably the most cogent answer Trump could have given to that question. That answer also happens to be extremely incorrect, as the costs of “building” would still be passed on to the consumer. Taken together, the net effects of his tariff plan would raise prices to the tune of <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/blog/donald-trump-10-percent-tariff/" target="_blank">more than $300 billion per year</a>, according to an estimate from the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan Washington think tank.</p><p class="">For a former president to be so stubbornly wrong about an Econ 101 concept is bad enough. What makes Trump’s lack of basic economic understanding truly maddening, though, is how little it’s reflected in public polling. A <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24614251-240126-nbc-april-2024-poll-4-26-2024-release" target="_blank">recent NBC News poll</a> found that Trump holds a 22-point lead among registered voters when asked whether he or President Joe Biden would be better at dealing with inflation and the cost of living. (It’s worth noting that this question was presented to 420 respondents, a smaller subset of the full 1,000-person poll.)</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">What makes Trump’s lack of basic economic understanding truly maddening, though, is how little it’s reflected in public polling. </p></div><p class="">Another <a href="https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/editorialfiles/2024/03/26/cnbcaaes.pdf" target="_blank">survey last month from CNBC</a> found similar results: 54% of respondents said Trump would do better on inflation, compared with 27% who gave the edge to Biden. On one level, Trump is most likely benefiting from <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-biden-economy-gdp-wages-inflation/" target="_blank">a bit of unearned nostalgia</a> for his time in office. After 3½ years with Biden in the White House, it’s easier for voters to tell themselves that someone else would be able to handle things better, even as most of the power to reduce inflation falls under the Federal Reserve’s purview. Even that is something that Trump has suggested the president take over, having all but demanded that the Fed’s chair follow the White House’s lead when he was in office.</p><p class="">But <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/01/07/trump-economy-inflation-biden-campaign/" target="_blank">most major economists agree</a> that Trump’s proposed economic policies would absolutely lead to higher costs. “Most of the major policy initiatives being suggested by Donald Trump’s campaign would be inflationary; whether it’s narrowing the trade deficit via tariffs or a dollar devaluation, curbing immigration or, now we learn, compromising the Fed’s independence,” Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist for London-based Capital Economics, <a href="https://www.capitaleconomics.com/publications/us-economics-update/trump-fed-and-dollar" target="_blank">wrote in an analysis</a> published Monday.</p><p class="endmark">Biden and other Democrats have begun to craft their messaging <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/12/business/biden-inflation-strategy-trump.html" target="_blank">to highlight the absurdity of Trump’s policies</a> and the economic pain they would cause. He’s also taken to calling out corporate greed for rising costs and the tax cuts for the wealthy that Trump signed into law. Unfortunately, trying to sway voters is about the best he can do to try to protect them from the damage that Trump would unleash. Because as his Time interview showed, once someone like Trump has dug in his heels, he remains committed to even the worst ideas, no matter how much evidence there is to show he’s nowhere close to being right.</p></div></div></body></html>'}

Rather, the state walked him through texts from that time that the jurors can not only see themselves as they learn about the case but also, ultimately, consider when they decide whether prosecutors have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt. Trump has pleaded not guilty to falsifying business records, which prosecutors say he did to cover up the hush money reimbursement to Michael Cohen, and denied having a sexual relationship with Daniels or McDougal.</p><p class="">With Davidson on the stand, prosecutors <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/live-blog/trump-trial-hush-money-case-live-updates-rcna149906/rcrd40372?canonicalCard=true" target="_blank">were able to show jurors</a> texts between him and Dylan Howard, the National Enquirer’s editor-in-chief at the time. Recall that the trial’s first witness, former National Enquirer publisher <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-trial-witness-enquirer-david-pecker-rcna149624" target="_blank">David Pecker</a>, testified that he was <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/david-pecker-trump-hush-money-trial-rcna148776" target="_blank">looking to kill negative Trump stories</a> to help the 2016 campaign.

{'It’s Only Tuesday', 'https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/prosecuting-donald-trump/s-only-tuesday-rcna150089', '<html><body><div><div class="article-body__content"><p class="">Donald Trump’s\xa0New York criminal trial is back in session Tuesday, as Judge Merchan fines Trump $9000 in gag order violations. Last week,\xa0David Pecker wrapped up his testimony, detailing\xa0the catch and kill scheme, and jurors also heard from Trump’s assistant, Rhona Graff, and bank executive Gary Farro. After examining the art of cross-examination, veteran prosecutors Andrew Weissmann and Mary McCord note the options available to Judge Merchan as he hears a second set of alleged gag order violations this Thursday. Plus: what Walt Nauta’s grand jury testimony indicates in the Florida documents case.\xa0\xa0</p><p class="">For further reading:\xa0<a href="https://www.nycourts.gov/LegacyPDFS/press/PDFs/D.O.motion4contempt-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">here is Judge Merchan’s decision on the gag order motion.</a>\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Hi, and welcome back to “Prosecuting Donald Trump.” It’s April 30th at 10:39 a.m. We’re giving dates and times these days because you’ll understand why in a moment.</p><p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"></p><p class="">Mary McCord: Eastern time.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Of course. I know. By the way, this just means everyone else is listening, not just in America, but there are all these people internationally who listen are probably not going to be like, click, hang up, like, you East Coast snob.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: They either add or subtract some hours, you know, they get it.\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: So, wait, by the way, I’m Andrew Weissmann and I’m here with --</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Mary McCord.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: We have a lot to cover.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yes, we do.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: But I do want to tell you a very quick anecdote that’s relevant to what we just talked about East Coast. When I was working on a case in Houston, Texas, like 20 years ago, everyone told me, don’t worry, Houston’s fourth largest city in America. It’s very cosmopolitan. And I was going down there and a lot of the prosecutors were either from New York or from San Francisco.\xa0</p><p class="">And I had all of these preconceived views about Texas. And I was told, no, no, no, don’t be ridiculous. And very soon after the trial started, it was one of the Enron cases, I wake up in my hotel room, look at the “Houston Chronicle” on the front page of “Houston Chronicle” in describing the trial. There is a quote that says about me that I’m an East Coast, Ivy League, Evian-swilling carpetbagger.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: And you took umbrage?</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Well, it’s very funny because at the time --</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Oh, you like, yeah, except for the carpetbagger part.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: My boss at the time goes, Andrew, that is so unfair. You don’t drink Evian. Okay. Anecdotes over. There’s a ton to cover. Mary, what’s on our dance card?</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Well, you know, really, frankly, hot off the presses this morning is Judge Merchan’s ruling on at least the first 10 charges of contempt for violating the gag order. So we’re going to talk about that. Then, of course, we will recap last week’s testimony that it was primarily David Pecker, the head of American Media.</p><p class="">And we will also touch on the other two witnesses that testified on Friday, one of whom is continuing this morning and give our impressions on that. And then finally, we’ll switch gears over to Mar-a-Lago case because there was some new news that came out of that yesterday when a transcript of Walt Nauta testifying up here in the District of Columbia well before, actually before even the search warrant was executed at Mar-a-Lago, that grand jury transcript was made public yesterday and people might be saying, huh, why so? And we’ll explain why, so.\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: That sounds great. So we’ll probably spend a lot more time on topics one and two.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yes.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: And particularly two, which is very much in the weeds of what happened on Friday. I think both of us think there’s a lot that is missing in the coverage and we want to get you into those details. But why don’t we cover what just happened this morning? The judge did issue a written order. One thing that our listeners should know is that if they go to the show notes, we actually will have a link to the actual gag order ruling by Judge Merchan so they can read exactly what he said.</p><p class="">But what was before the court was the district attorney had alleged 10 violations of the gag order by Donald Trump at various times and places in various contexts. They had also offered various exhibits to substantiate that. And the judge had a hearing last week where he heard from both sides as to their defenses. That is not to be confused with something that is going to be heard this Thursday, which is that there are additional claims of violations that the court is going to hear this Thursday morning.</p><p class="">So this is a ruling on the prior ones, but there are more upcoming. And then to remind people, under the statute that operates for criminal contempt, the judge has, under that statute, has a sort of binary choice of a fine of up to $1,000. We’ll talk about that because the judge talks about it, per violation and 30 days in jail per violation. So those are his options on that.</p><p class="">But that’s sort of the table setter. And this morning, I think he somewhat surprised people. We were waiting for a decision and he gave his decision. And as we said, he has a written order. So, Mary, that’s sort of the background. What did you think of it and what do you think of his written decision as well?\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: I mean, it’s a short decision, but there’s a lot in here. I mean, first, just as to substance, he rejects Donald Trump’s arguments that reposts of things that other people posted on social media are not Donald Trump’s own pronouncements, own statements, because that was one of the arguments. Several of the actual social media postings that the prosecutors argued violated the gag order were just that, they were reposts.\xa0</p><p class="">And the court completely rejects that. He says both the Truth Social account and the official campaign website, because some of these reposts were on the campaign website, exclusively represent the opinions and views of the defendant. Neither is an open forum for others to post their own content. Defendant curated the posts at issue, took the steps necessary to publish the posts on his Truth Social account and on his campaign website. And in doing so, he endorsed the posts with one purpose in mind, to maximize viewership and to communicate his stamp of approval.</p><p class="">And the judge goes on to talk about how Donald Trump has bragged that when he posts things on Truth Social, so many followers see it immediately and he has everything. He’s even said when I put out a statement, it is spread all over the place, fast and furious. Everybody seems to get whatever I have to say and quickly.</p><p class="">And Judge Merchan used that to say, these are your statements. These are your posts, your endorsements. I’m rejecting your argument that reposts cannot violate the gag order.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Can I just say with exhibit 10, which is one of the allegations. Actually, this is the one that’s gotten a lot of attention, the Jesse Watters one --\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Right.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: -- which is allegedly a repost. And the judge in a footnote says it’s actually not a repost because although it’s in quotations, Donald Trump actually added words that were not actually in the Jesse Watters original. So, it’s not even a correct quote. And he just says this isn’t fallen. Even if you accepted a repost argument, it would not cover this.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Exactly. No, that’s right. The second sort of legal point he made before ruling on these is that he rejected in part, I’d say, the argument that Mr. Trump was merely responding to political attacks. Now, he had given him some leeway in earlier discussions about as an expected nominee.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Presumptive nominee.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Presumptive nominee in the middle of a presidential campaign. He’s got to have some leeway, right, to campaign and respond to attacks. But he said, look, Mr. Blanche, you have not connected every one of Mr. Trump’s posts to a specific political attack for the most part and I can’t just take you blanketly saying these are all in response to political attacks and just say, okay, therefore, they don’t violate the gag order.\xa0</p><p class="">Now, he made one exception to that, which is the judge found that there was not adequate nexus between this argument, I’m merely responding to a political attack. That one exception had to deal with a post that Michael Cohen posted of a different social media post by Michael Avenatti. Remember, an original attorney to Stormy Daniels back before he himself went to prison for various criminal violations.</p><p class="">At any rate, this had to do with sort of taunting whether Mr. Trump might pardon Mr. Avenatti. That one, the court decided he was not going to find was contemptuous, was not a violation of the gag order. For the other nine, he said, I’m going to impose this $1,000 fine per violation. They all are violations.</p><p class="">Okay, so here’s where it gets interesting, though. The court then goes on --\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Can I just make one point, which is that because it’s criminal contempt, it’s useful to know that the judge found that the state had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt in terms of the finding that Donald Trump knew of the order and willfully violated it.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Right.\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: So those are the things that are necessary. Okay. So then he has the $9,000, which is $1,000. You know what, even although I’d never do math in public --</p><p class="">Mary McCord: You could do that math.\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: -- I would. I could do this one, nine times a thousand.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: One times nine.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, exactly.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Right. So, you know, the maximum would have been $10,000 here, $1,000 each. But now he does two very important things, I think, in this opinion. First is he does talk about his recognition of the defendant’s First Amendment rights, particularly given his candidacy for the office of the presidency. He explains how it’s important that his legitimate free speech rights not be curtailed and that he be able to fully campaign for office.</p><p class="">And he also says it’s important, though, at the same time that the court, of course, protect the administration of justice and protect witnesses, but that his gag order should not be used as a sword instead of a shield by potential witnesses. In other words, if a witness say, I think here he didn’t name names, but potentially Michael Cohen, potentially Stormy Daniels, actually sort of uses this gag order thinking, I can go ahead and I can attack Trump and attack Trump and attack Trump and I’m protected.</p><p class="">He’s saying, I’m going to start taking that into account potentially, says consideration of such usage again as a sword rather than a shield will be weighed by this court when ruling on the willfulness of any future claims of alleged violations of the gag orders, as well as when determining appropriate punishment, if any.\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: And also he said he might actually take them away from the protection of the gag order because he said it would sort of undermine the utility. And he basically he’s saying, watch it. And, you know, what’s very interesting is Michael Cohen, a few days ago through his counsel, issued a statement saying that he is not going to be saying anything anymore. And I think it probably was reading. He saw what the defense argument is here. And essentially it’s sort of goose gander.</p><p class="">It’s like, you know, if you start attacking this person like crazy, that’s not the purpose of the gag order, is to protect you and protect witnesses. So, you know, it doesn’t look like you’re needing protection, there’s no reason to have you there.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: And that’s exactly what the court said, right. He said the protected party turns the underlying purpose of this gag order on its head, it becomes apparent the protected party likely does not need to be protected. I would also say before we move to that last thing on Michael Cohen, because I think you’re right that he and his attorneys probably saw, oh, you know, things may change in terms of this gag order if I continue with these attacks.</p><p class="">Also, come on, he’s going to be a government witness. Stop adding to all of the things you’re going to get cross-examined on about how biased you are against Mr. Trump.\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Mary? Mary? Mary?\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yes?\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Too late.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yes, I know it is too late in a way at this point. Like, it’s just, anyway. But when we get to Michael Cohen, we’ll have lots to discuss about his baggage. Okay, the other really significant thing is the judge made a whole point in terms of his punishment of saying under the law, the limit for punishment in terms of a fine per violation is $1,000.</p><p class="">But he says that might suffice in many instances to protect the integrity of the judicial system and to punish the offender for disobeying the court’s order. However, he says in some cases that might not be enough. In some cases, it might be a $2,500 fine or $150,000 fine. But he can’t give that kind of fine in this case because the law limits him to $1,000.</p><p class="">So he then explicitly says because this court doesn’t have discretion to raise the fine, it must therefore consider whether in some instances jail may be a necessary punishment.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, I’m going to just quote from it so that people have it. Quote, “it would be preferable if the court could impose a fine more commensurate with the wealth of the contemnor. In some cases, that might be a $2,500 fine. In other cases, it might be a fine of $150,000 because this court is not cloaked. That’s what you were saying, Mary, is not cloaked with such discretion. It must therefore consider whether in some instances jail may be necessary punishment,” unquote.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: And then he goes on to warn him. Defendant is hereby warned that the court will not tolerate continued willful violations of its lawful orders and that if necessary and appropriate under the circumstances, it will impose an incarceratory punishment.\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: So the other thing he did is he ordered that the nine posts be taken down by 2:15 today, Tuesday, April 30th. And one thing that he didn’t do is he didn’t essentially create a babysitter, like a monitor over future posts. He also, in imposing the sentence now, didn’t sort of do things to dangle over Donald Trump’s head. You know, I’m going to hold off sentencing.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yeah.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: This is something Neal Katyal had thought might be possible, which is to sort of keep that as a sort of Damocles or as our friend Ryan Goodman suggested, say, I want you to be aware that these violations and future violations can be considered by me if there were to be a conviction in this case in sentencing you.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Right.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: That would be true whether he finds the contempt now or not.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: That’s right.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: So it’ll be interesting to see whether he does do that. In other words, I thought there were other tools in his tool kit --</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yes.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: -- that he could have used and he could have changed the gag order, for instance, to say there’s now going to be this additional restriction on you in terms of posting. I think if I were in his shoes, I would think about that. He’s clearly frustrated by the $1,000 limitation or jail. And so if you’re thinking about reasons, you know, you don’t want to jump to jail.\xa0</p><p class="">And in part, I know many listeners would think, why the hell not? But in some ways, that will be such a huge distraction from the testimony.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yes.</p><p class="">\xa0Andrew Weissmann: Just think about last week. David Pecker’s testimony was so damaging that if you’re Donald Trump, you want anything to distract from that.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: And his arguments about being the victim of a weaponized New York system would just get that much louder if he were actually jailed.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: That much more oxygen. But as I said, one thing to keep an eye on is we have more gag order violations coming up. And this is not the first time that Trump has been found in violation. If you remember, Judge Engoron in the New York civil attorney general’s case has found him in violation twice before. So this is now the third time a judge has found contempt. And so there has been a lot of notices here. So it’ll be interesting to see on Thursday. That’ll be the hearing. And then we’ll see what the judge does with that.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Just before we go to break, I do want to flag one thing about the hearing on Thursday, because of the four additional alleged violations of the gag order that the D.A.’s office has asked for the judge to consider and that the judge will be considering on Thursday. One of those is a new type of violation.</p><p class="">Most of the alleged violations have had to do with attacks on potential witnesses, attacks on the jury. This is actually something that looks more like trying to curry favor with a witness. And this was a statement that Mr. Trump made on the morning of April 25th when he had a press event in Manhattan and when he was asked a question about David Pecker’s ongoing testimony, he said, he’s been very nice. I mean, David’s been very nice, a nice guy.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Gee, Mary, where have I heard something like that before? Paul Manafort?</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yep. This happens.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: I mean, it’s so blatant. This is like carrot and sticks.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yeah.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Right? I mean, this is not something where you’re like, gee, I wonder what’s going on. So, okay, let’s take a break. And then I know the two of us are completely loaded for bear to talk about what happened on Friday and to get into some of the details. So let’s take a break and we’ll come back and do that.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Sounds good.</p><p class="">(ADVERTISEMENT)</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Hey, Mary. So, one, I need to apologize to you because apparently our producers and you were hearing birds in the background.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Don’t apologize. I love the birds.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: You know what I love? So I’m the city slicker. And so everyone’s like, who’s got birds? Who’s got birds?</p><p class="">Mary McCord: They thought it was me.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Of course, no one’s thinking it. Yeah, exactly because no one’s going to think it’s me. I’m like in the middle of New York City and --\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: There are birds there.\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. New York, we’re friendly.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yes, yes.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: We have owls, a very famous owl.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yes.\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: And no, Vicki Vergolina, we don’t just have pigeons.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: That’s right.\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Although the New York pigeon, love the New York pigeon.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: But those were not pigeons we were hearing. They do not make that noise.\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Okay. So, Mary, let’s talk about what happened on Friday and the witnesses there. David Pecker, Rhona Graff, and Gary Farro were the three witnesses. As you noted, Gary Farro continues today. David Pecker was on cross-examination for most of the morning and some of the afternoon. And then there’s something called redirect, where the state gets to ask questions to sort of clear up anything.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: The people. They like to call themselves the people.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Yep, the people of the state of New York. And they have to do redirect directed at things that came up on cross. Then there is recross, a limited recross. But again, it has to be directed at things that came up on redirect. And then it ends. It usually doesn’t go back and forth and back and forth and back and forth. Recross itself is sort of --</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Disfavored even itself.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Yes, exactly.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: So just so that in case people hear this term being used outside of our podcast, what Andrew was just talking about, it means it has to be within the scope. So when you redirect, that has to be within the scope of things that came up on cross. When you recross, that has to be within the scope of things that came up on redirect.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: It’s not new stuff.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yeah.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: So I wanted to focus just on two things and then turn it over to you, Mary, because I think there wasn’t enough attention on two types of arguments that were being made. And there were lots and lots of things that came up in the cross and redirect as a chance to answer those. And in some ways, like the ideal situation is lots and lots of issues get raised on cross and redirect as an opportunity if you’re a right and a good prosecutor to have the jury go, oh --\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Those weren’t such a big deal. Yeah.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: What seemed like a big deal is actually very explainable. And if it really is good, essentially, you’re not saying it, but what the message is, is don’t trust cross because there was actually a really good answer to that and it was kind of misleading.</p><p class="">But having said that, I want people to understand that Emil Bove, who is the defense lawyer who did the cross, you know, he only has a certain number of cards to play.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: That’s right.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: In other words, he’s dealt a hand like in poker and he has to play that hand. Obviously, he has to stay within the rules, but there’s only so much he can do. And his job is to poke holes. And it isn’t necessarily to have a consistent, wonderful theory, because sometimes it’s hard to have a consistent, wonderful theory and it’s like a smorgasbord. You sort of want to just find one juror and so you offer a lot of things like the witness is mistaken. The witness is a liar. You know --\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Bad memory.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: -- maybe you think both. Yeah, exactly. And so none of this is a criticism of him. In fact, I think he did a pretty good job. But my big takeaway is that I thought the redirect was pretty sensational.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: I thought it was really good at answering the questions I had after cross was like, ooh, is that a problem, and came back and redirect. Nope, that’s not a problem.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. I very much sort of was thinking, oh, he did that very effectively and I just thought Josh Steinglass, who is the prosecutor, did a really nice job. There were lots and lots of issues that he raised, but I thought there were two key ones. One was answered and one is a little Easter egg that I think we’re going to see down the road that wasn’t answered yet, but I think it will be.</p><p class="">So I think the big picture theme that both was trying to hit on cross was this idea that the agreements that were reached between AMI and Karen McDougal, that the things that AMI agreed to with the Southern District of New York in reaching its non-prosecution agreement, that essentially this was all legal, that there was no campaign violation, that in the negotiation, for instance, with the FEC, the Federal Election Committee, that Pecker had taken the position that there was no campaign violation, that with respect to the Southern District of New York non-prosecution agreement, he wasn’t pleading guilty to some campaign violation.</p><p class="">And this was pretty critical in cross, that when the agreement with Karen McDougal and AMI, the “National Enquirer,” was reached, that the general counsel of AMI, Cam Stracher, had approved that, that this had all been approved by lawyers, that there were outside lawyers that approved it. There was in-house lawyers that approved it. So this idea that there was a violation is wrong, that it was lawyered, that he’d never said it, that it was a violation, that it’s all sort of now he’s saying it, but it wasn’t said before.</p><p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"></p><p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"></p><p class="">And that lawyers had looked at all of this, and it was all blessed by lawyers. So how can you now say that this is illegal? Or someone in good faith could think it was not a campaign violation, at the very least. That was sort of a big theme. And as I said, it came up with respect to the agreement with Karen McDougal. It came up in terms of what was admitted between AMI and the Southern District of New York. It came up in connection with the litigation with the FEC, not to be confused with the SEC.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Right. Federal Election Commission.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Right. So that sort of came up over and over again, and that was as close to a theme in cross. And that’s sort of the big one. I mean, there are lots and lots of other little things that aren’t worth our time at this point. But that’s where I was thinking, like you, Mary, I wonder what he’s going to say to that.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yes.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: So here’s one really big answer that I thought was just fascinating, was first he said, okay, let’s just take the Karen McDougal agreement. He goes, Mr. Pecker, when you were dealing with your general counsel, Cam Stracher, did you tell him that you had a private agreement with Donald Trump to do three things, be his eyes and ears as a presidential candidate, to foment fake stories on his behalf and to run them by him.</p><p class="">And third, to engage in a catch and kill scheme? Whether you call it catch and kill, whether you call it finding bad stories and alerting them so that they can figure out what to do, whatever you want to call the scheme, those three pieces. And he’s essentially, the answer was, of course not.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: That’s right.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: And he’s like, so all the lawyer was opining on was a piece of paper that didn’t have the actual agreement.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: The reason for it.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. It just was like a normal looking contract. And we know that --</p><p class="">Mary McCord: And a contract, just to be clear, by which it wasn’t just we’re paying money to Karen McDougal for a story. Also, it was we’re going to provide her opportunities to be on the cover of our magazines and to write for us and all of these things. So it just looks kind of like an employment contract type of a thing.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, exactly. And what was great is it was like and what was the reason for all of that sort of embroidery? And it was like, oh, that was just cover for the catch and kill scheme. And he said, in fact, wouldn’t it have been the “National Enquirer’s” interest, financial interest to run her story? And this is the great catch line, which I refer to as a summation line, is wouldn’t it have been “National Enquirer” gold?</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yes.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: That was the phrase. “National Enquirer” gold to run this story. And he’s like, absolutely. And Emil Bove tried to say on recross, well, no, isn’t it the case that Karen McDougal was a celebrity in her own right? And that’s what I would call like, don’t --</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Don’t go there. Just don’t do it.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: -- don’t question too many because he’s like, no.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yeah, right.\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: I mean, it’s like, no, he explained.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yeah.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: I mean, he’s just like a celebrity, not by our definition. I mean, wasn’t she a well-known like fitness model? And he sort of was like, well, she was a fitness model. You know, I mean, it was just --</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Right.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: -- like, come on. So that sort of fell flat. And then Josh Steinglass pointed out just how different these agreements were with respect to the doorman and Karen McDougal, that there was so much more money, that there was a penalty clause in the doorman’s for of a million dollars for a breach, that these were not your typical things that they do for celebrities. And this was all in connection with a campaign violation.\xa0</p><p class="">So I think that was very neutralized. I wanted to quickly turn to a second thing and then turn it over to you, Mary, which is, I think one of the themes that just got sort of mentioned, but we’re going to hear later is that on cross, David Pecker was asked, well, isn’t it true that Michael Cohen had his own personal relationship with Keith Davidson, who is the lawyer for Stormy Daniels?\xa0</p><p class="">And he said, yes, I learned that. And he said, so you’re not aware of what side deals they may have had. And he’s like, of course not. And so I think we’re going to hear that because they have to explain what was going on with the reimbursement, like why Michael Cohen took out a home equity line for $130,000 and this reimbursement of over $400,000 from Donald Trump.\xa0</p><p class="">They’re going to have to come up with a theory that this was some private scam between Michael Cohen and Mr. Davidson. So I think that was the reason for that. I mean, good luck in terms of that. But I think they just wanted to get a little bit of what they could from David Pecker, that there was this relationship and that line about you’re not aware of some side deal makes me think they’re going to try and push that when Michael Cohen takes the stand.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yeah. And that happens a lot with early witnesses. There’s like these few tidbits out there and the jury’s probably kind of scratching their head thinking, what does that connect to? And it’ll get connected up later. And then even if it later, the jury is maybe not making the connection. That’s what closing argument is about. That’s what summation is about. Let me make those connections for you.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Exactly.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: And you hear that with things. Remember, David Pecker was asked about the different phone numbers he had had over the relevant years. Those are going to come back later and be in some records, right. And some of this also happened with respect to the examinations of the other witnesses on Friday, besides David Pecker --\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Yes, very much.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: -- which we’ll get to in a minute. I agree with all of the points you just made. I wanted to give a little flavor of the same way that things work in terms of redirect on the conciliation agreement with the FEC. Because again, on cross-examination, David Pecker had been, you know, basically pushed to look at particular pages of that FEC conciliation agreement --\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Yes.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: -- where it says there’s no admission of any kind of liability for campaign finance violations. And remember, folks, the campaign finance violation comes from the idea that if you have done something of value for a candidate without it complying with the campaign finance regulations, which include limitations on the amount of money or other things of value that can be contributed, there’s reporting requirements, there’s monetary limitations, all that.\xa0</p><p class="">If you provide something of value, such as paying off a source to squash a story in order to help someone’s campaign, that can be a campaign finance violation. And I think in many ways, the reason that David Pecker ever cooperated with prosecutors in this case is because the FEC came knocking on his door. And recall, we talked about last week that that happened after he had had a similar experience back when he had caught and killed stories about Arnold Schwarzenegger when he was running for governor, stories that would have been negative to Mr. Schwarzenegger.</p><p class="">He had, you know, recognized then that those were campaign finance violations. So when the FEC came knocking this time, he thought, okay, we need to resolve this. So after on cross-examination, it looks like this agreement with the FEC sort of absolved AMI of any sort of liability. Of course, the prosecutor comes back on redirect and says, yes, Mr. Bove showed you a page of that agreement, right? Yes, he did, you know.</p><p class="">And this page contains some additional language, right, that you guys didn’t talk about. Yeah. So and that’s what it says. The following language, solely for the purpose of settling this matter and avoiding litigation and with no admission as to the merit of the commission’s legal conclusions, respondent, that means AMI, agrees not to contest that AMI’s payment to Karen McDougal to purchase a limited life story right, combined with this decision not to publish the story in consultation with an agent of Donald J. Trump and for the purpose of influencing the election, constituted a prohibitive corporate in-kind contribution in violation of.</p><p class="">And then there’s a specific site to the U.S. code that covers campaign finance violations. So again, this is the oh, but boom, what happened in cross maybe has a big explanation, which is this was part of your agreement. You said, AMI, I’m not going to contest that what we did was prohibitive conduct.\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. And the same thing happened with the Southern District of New York.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yes.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: And there was just a lot of that stuff. One quick thing, which happens all the time at trials, which is somewhat related to what you’re saying, which is the number of times a witness is confronted with an FBI interview report that says something different or doesn’t have a statement in it. And of course, that happened with this witness and he handled it really well. He goes, look, I don’t know what the FBI wrote or didn’t write. All I know is what I told.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: That’s right.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Which is like, you know, that’s the answer. And one of the questions that typically, so are you saying the FBI may have made a mistake? And the answer that this is the defense wants to use, like, how could the FBI make a mistake? And as a prosecutor --</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Oh my gosh.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: -- the number of times I’m sitting there going, oh, yeah, that’s what happened.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yeah. Yeah.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: You know, and it’s also makes sense.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: They’re human beings. They’re taking notes.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: You know, this is the advantage, actually, of recording something.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: That’s right.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: When you have a recorded statement, it’s really easy because then you really don’t have this issue. It’s either there or it’s not there. So that was one on the three I choose. It’s like, yes, they sort of point out the FBI. Are you saying the FBI made a mistake? And the answer is like, yes, that is what happened. The FBI did make a mistake.\xa0</p><p class="">I would say here what was really interesting, it was really similar to the example you gave where the prosecutor on redirect pointed out like it was basically at the same or the connected interviews, like whether it was on day one or day two, he had actually said the same thing. So this is where judgment really comes in on a defense lawyer about how much weight can an argument or can a point make? And you don’t want to get caught sort of overselling or overstressing something.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yeah.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Final point, Emil Bove at a sidebar told the judge, you know, this is my first time as a defense lawyer cross examining.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yeah.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: I’ve never cross examined. He was a federal prosecutor like you and me, Mary. By the way, I thought he did a very good job as a defense lawyer, especially for this first time. It is remarkable to me that he did the cross. And, you know, there is one defense lawyer in that room who has done this repeatedly and extremely well, which is Susan Necheles.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Right. Yeah. We can speculate about that, but we won’t, okay.\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Okay. The other witnesses.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yeah.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Rhona Graff and Gary Farro.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: So Rhona Graff, you know, long, long time, 34-year executive assistant to Mr. Trump, I think a significant and I didn’t necessarily hear this so much reported. People were talking about how she testified that The Trump Organization had contact information for Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels in its records. And I thought, okay, well, that’s important and that corroborates things. But how important is it?</p><p class="">Well, when you read the transcript, it’s not just The Trump Organization. She says she was the executive assistant who maintained Mr. Trump’s contacts in The Trump Organization computer system and that she did that so that those contacts, the question was included information such as phone numbers and addresses for people in his life that he wanted to be able to contact is the question. She answers, that is correct.</p><p class="">So this isn’t just the huge Trump organization having somewhere in its records the name Stormy Daniels or the name Karen McDougal. This is her as an executive assistant to Donald Trump, keeping his personal contacts and his personal contacts included Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels. So, again, this is just part of that little bits of corroboration that is stacking up to show that he knew these people were and he was remaining in contact with these people or had contacts with these people.\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Absolutely. And, you know, people analogize this to your building a wall and there are lots of different pieces to that and lots of bricks. And so these are all sort of the connective tissue to be able to prove it. Gary Farro, who’s on the stand now, is somebody who works at First Republic. He is the person who helped Michael Cohen as his banker established this company called Essential Consulting.</p><p class="">That is the vehicle that was used to pay the money from Essential Consulting, obviously at the direction of Michael Cohen. And he funded Essential Consulting with his home equity line.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Right.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: I mean, talk about something like, you know, this is a lawyer doing this. And by the way, you know from David Pecker why he had to, because David Pecker said, you know, it gets to Stormy Daniels.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: I’m not paying.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: I’m not paying because you know what, he says I thought this was fascinating. He’s like, we already paid out for the doorman. We already paid out for Karen McDougal. And I did want to and I was planning on getting reimbursed by Donald Trump, but I had a conversation with my general counsel, the same general counsel that we talked about before. And he obviously can’t say what that conversation was because it’s showing client privilege.</p><p class="">But he says after that, I couldn’t do it anymore. So I guess that’s general counsel going, you want to do what? And his general counsel is like, you have to rip up the agreement and you cannot take the money. So David Pecker calls up Michael Cohen and says, we’re out. I’m no longer your banker. So he obviously knows that it’s illegal. It’s improper. He’s not doing it. But it also meant Michael Cohen now had to come up with the pool of money that he’s going to use to get the Stormy Daniels story suppressed.</p><p class="">And so Gary Farro is talking about that. He’s also talking about what he’s being represented by Michael Cohen, about what Essential Consulting is. He’s not being told the truth.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Real estate consulting.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, exactly, which, you know, in many ways is kind of right. It’s real. If you think about it, Donald Trump, real estate mogul, I’m consulting.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yes. Okay. And at very 35,000 foot level.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Yes.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Significant here was, though, Mr. Farro explaining that when you do open an account, right, you are asked is among the various questions the bank wants to protect itself. It wants to protect itself against the risk of facilitating any type of crimes. Those include, as Mr. Farro discussed, crimes with transferring money to sanctioned countries or sanctioned individuals under some of our, you know, foreign policy sanction regimes that we have.\xa0</p><p class="">But also is making sure they’re not facilitating campaign finance violations. And so one of the questions is, you know, is this entity, this account being used for any political campaign purposes or PAC fundraising purposes? And the answer, Mr. Cohen put on the form was no.\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Basically you committed bank fraud and it would have been a huge problem or at least slowed things down at First Republic.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: He might not have been able to use the account to pay off Stormy Daniels if he had told the truth.\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. So you really get the sense with David Pecker and all of this, that the issue of the law was like this is the speed bump rules. That’s like for the little people. And I think one of the things that’s sort of big picture about David Pecker, he was so remorseless.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yeah.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: There was none of this, I’m so sorry that I engaged in election fraud or that I was engaging in intentional defamation --\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Right.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: -- that I did this. It’s like, yep, yep, but that true self in many ways is why he seems so credible.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: I thought so, too. If he did come off otherwise, I’m not sure people would have thought that it was legitimate, so. Okay, shall we go to break? And then we will talk very briefly about new developments in Mar-a-Lago.</p><p class="">(ADVERTISEMENT)</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Welcome back. As promised, we are going to talk briefly about the transcript of testimony that Walt Nauta. Remember, he is one of the co-conspirators charged along with Donald Trump in the Mar-a-Lago indictment. He’s Mr. Trump’s valet. He’s somebody who’s accused not of the substantive mishandling of classified information counts, but of the obstruction of justice, both by allegedly moving boxes of classified documents in order to withhold them from Mr. Trump’s attorney, Evan Corcoran, who had come there to go through the boxes in response to a government subpoena and also for his alleged efforts, along with another Trump employee, Carlos de Oliveira, to try to destroy surveillance videos from Mar-a-Lago that could have been damaging to Mr. Trump.</p><p class="">So the reason this transcript came out, this is a transcript of Walt Nauta testifying before a grand jury in Washington, D.C. at the time before the Mar-a-Lago case had been brought, even before the search warrant of Mar-a-Lago had happened. And it was testimony as Jack Smith was investigating the mishandling of classified information, sort of in its early stages.\xa0</p><p class="">Now, everyone knows that case was later transferred down to Florida and a whole new grand jury impaneled down there. That’s the grand jury that heard evidence in support of the criminal charges that were brought there. And the reason this came to light is because in that Mar-a-Lago criminal prosecution, Mr. Nauta had filed various motions to dismiss his indictment.\xa0</p><p class="">And one of those motions was to dismiss his indictment on the grounds of vagueness, that these charges of obstruction of justice are too vague as they are applied to him because they require him to have done things with corrupt intent. And we don’t know what a corrupt intent means. And by the way, as this grand jury transcript from D.C. reveals, I didn’t even know what was in those boxes. So how could I possibly be getting charged with moving boxes with corrupt intent to obstruct an official proceeding?\xa0</p><p class="">Because as I testified up in Washington, D.C., I didn’t even know what was in them. I thought mostly it was newspaper articles and hats and T-shirts and paraphernalia. And I think at one point he said he didn’t even know what the cover page of a classified document looked like. So that’s why he had attached that grand jury transcript.</p><p class="">Judge Cannon held a hearing on this and other motions maybe two weeks ago at this point. She denied those motions. She said, this is an issue for the jury. You can argue to the jury that you didn’t know what is in the boxes. I’m not dismissing the case on those grounds. And then said, because this was an exhibit, we should make this public unless there’s anything that needed to be redacted.</p><p class="">The only thing that needs to be redacted are the names of potential witnesses, other employees of Mar-a-Lago who might be witnesses. Those were redacted. And this was made public yesterday. So of course, we all ran and read it real quickly. I thought it was kind of underwhelming, but there are some points in there that are interesting.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: So the date of the grand jury transcript is June 21st, 2022. It’s as part of the investigation, and it’s about a month and change prior to the search at Mar-a-Lago. So I had one sort of factoid that I thought was interesting, which is Walt Nauta said that Donald Trump’s office in Mar-a-Lago was actually in the, quote, “bridal suite,” unquote.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: That’s true. I wondered about that.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: So if you’re wondering what they’re doing with the bridal suite at Mar-a-Lago, that’s his office. So that’s the interesting or not so interesting factoid. The other is like, why on God’s green earth did he testify? I mean, like he should have taken the fifth because so much of his testimony sort of disproves his interview.\xa0</p><p class="">He had been interviewed just a few weeks before by the FBI, where he basically was, I don’t know anything about these boxes or where they moved or I never saw them prior to moving them later. And then he testifies under oath that, oh, no, no, no. He was like moving them. And then we know from the indictment, assuming it’s accurate, but they quote text messages that he has where he’s clearly moving these things.\xa0</p><p class="">So between the grand jury testimony that was unsealed and those text messages, you know, let’s just say there’s a lot of explaining to do, you know, because it’s very inconsistent. And the final piece is the sort of dangling of pardons problem. This is somebody in a normal case, but it happens all the time in public corruption cases. It happens in organized crime cases. It happens in any sort of group case where there’s powerful people at the top of the group where underlings really should be just telling the truth about what happened.</p><p class="">But there are all sorts of pressures on them not to, whether it’s financial pressures, whether sometimes it’s loyalty. In this case, it could also be the idea that, you know what, I’m indicted now, but there’s information from at least one witness that’s now public where the information is that Walt Nauta was told, don’t worry, Donald Trump, if he’s re-elected, is going to pardon you.\xa0</p><p class="">And I mean, does anyone who’s listening to this think that that’s not going to happen if he’s reelected? I mean, look at the Mueller investigation where he categorically went through every single person who didn’t cooperate with us and pardoned them. So, you know, Walt Nauta, that’s a big bet on his part in terms of his future. But that’s sort of my take in terms of what’s going on here.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Well, and it’s interesting, too, because one of the things that he was asked during this grand jury testimony was whether he had talked to Mr. Trump about the fact that he was being interviewed by the FBI or about the fact that he had been subpoenaed to the grand jury. And he said that he had told him and that in both cases what Mr. Trump said to him was, go in there, handle it, do what you need to do, and I’ll see you when you get back. So how do you take that? I mean, multiple interpretations.\xa0</p><p class="">Last thing I will say is that, you know, we’ve set out this timing for a reason, because even though I think the 67 pages, you know, doesn’t have any earth-shattering stuff in it, it clearly gave the government some of the probable cause that it needed to get that search warrant, because he did clearly talk about there being many, many, many, many, many, many, many boxes that were in the storage room that were moved to Mr. Trump’s offices. You know, at one point, I think he agreed at least 100 boxes and also the residence, not in the storage unit. And as everyone knows, stated that many of them remained, I think, in the office or in the residence, not in the storage unit.</p><p class="">And as everyone knows, they will recall when Mr. Corcoran, Mr. Trump’s attorney, went to try to look through boxes to comply with the subpoena for classified information, there were just a limited number of those boxes in the storage room. That was the only place he was told to look. He reviewed all of the materials in those boxes. He had a small number of classified information documents, which he turned over to the prosecutors, but he was not told to go look in the residence or in the office or any place else where boxes were obviously found.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: So unfortunately, I think this is all fascinating, but, you know, there are lots and lots of pending motions that have not yet been decided by Judge Cannon and there is no trial date.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: That’s right.\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: So this is like General Francisco Franco is still dead. And that little old reference to Saturday Night Live. But anyway, this is like Judge Cannon still hasn’t given a trial date. And, you know, there’s nothing about the Supreme Court argument that we talked about last week that is going to make her think that the Supreme Court is going to particularly view her shenanigans with a jaundiced eye, even though the 11th Circuit might.</p><p class="">So with that, Mary, we will continue monitoring the trial and other updates and have a wonderful weekend and I’ll see you on the other side of it.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: It’s Tuesday.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Oh, my God. It’s Tuesday?</p><p class="">Mary McCord: It’s Tuesday morning. Okay.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Okay. So, Mary, lots to continue. We have the trial today, Tuesday. I think we’re off Wednesday. Then we have a Thursday and Friday dates. There’s the contempt hearing on Thursday. Lots that we’ll have on Friday to discuss.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: We will see you then.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: So as the trial continues in New York, Mary and I are going to bring you new episodes twice a week to keep you up to speed. Tuesdays and Fridays, although sometimes Tuesdays feel like Fridays. And we want to answer your questions as they come up.\xa0</p><p class="">You can leave us a voicemail at 917-342-2934 or you can e-mail us at prosecutingtrumpquestions@nbcuni.com. As I mentioned, we really do read all of them and our team reads them and we talk about them. So even if we don’t get to them on air, you should know that we’re actually thinking about them and it does inform what we should be covering. So thanks so much. And thanks so much for listening.

She joins WITHpod to discuss the rise of big tech, the trajectory of the internet from being more commercialized to open, concerns about tech’s role in American democracy, her thoughts on proposed TikTok bans and more.</em></p><p class=""><em>Note: This is a rough transcript — please excuse any typos.</em></p><p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"></p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: The business model in tech is monetizing surveillance. And if you want to focus seriously on privacy, which requires, you know, not adopting that business model, not monetizing data you collect, either through training AI models or selling ads or what have you, then you cannot be pressured by commercial incentives to put profit and growth above that mission, which is, you know, ultimately what a commercial entity is bound to do.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Hello, and welcome to “Why Is This Happening?” with me, your host, Chris Hayes.</p><p class="">It’s been a very weird last year or so in tech, in the sort of broad universe of Silicon Valley and the internet and the digital world. There was this enormous bubble that happened during COVID and huge skyrocketing of valuations, lots of money sloshing around, lots of huge expansions and hiring. And there were these two huge bubbles that formed.</p><p class="">One was the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency bubble, which has, I would say, subsequently popped and also reinflated. So that’s one. And then remember, there was the whole metaverse bubble. Mark Zuckerberg changed the name of the company to Meta because they were going to put all this investment, I think it was literally billions of dollars of investment, into the metaverse, which is going to be this virtual world.</p><p class="">There are people on the metaverse, which I never actually quite understood, who are buying property on the metaverse for like six figures. It wasn’t real. I mean, I guess everyone knew that, but I never quite understood it. It seemed like a ludicrous bubble that has obviously since popped and I think shown to be a ludicrous bubble. In the wake of all that, there’s been a lot of retrenchment. There’s been big layoffs in Silicon Valley.</p><p class="">There’s been a kind of creeping sense of maybe that we’re at the end of some kind of era, Web 2.0, it’s often called. And then, of course, there’s now the rise of this new technology that everyone’s going all in on, which is AI, artificial intelligence, large language models, generative AI, ChatGPT, huge amounts of money investment going into that. The chip maker, NVIDIA, that makes the chips necessary to really have the sufficient computing power to do large language models has seen an enormous run up in its stock price and its projections of future earnings.</p><p class="">And, you know, I feel kind of two ways about this. One is this technology seems incredibly promising in certain ways and sort of astonishing. And also, it does feel like Silicon Valley scrambling around to find the next big thing. And the last next big thing was an enormous bust. So should we think the same thing’s going to happen here? And so I wanted to get a kind of big picture view of where we are at this moment in the internet and in tech. One of my favorite thinkers on this is both a sort of theorist and practitioner whose name is Meredith Whittaker.</p><p class="">Now, she actually runs a tech company, which is the Signal app. Signal’s a messaging service, encrypted messaging service. You might use it. It’s also a nonprofit. It’s probably the biggest nonprofit tech company out there and we get to talk about that. But she’s also a really interesting thinker and writer. She also co-founded and was chief advisor at the AI Now Institute. She was at Google where she was very active on AI issues as well. And so for the kind of broad view of where we are right now, this very strange moment in tech, I thought it’d be a great time to check in with Meredith Whittaker.</p><p class="">Meredith, it’s great to have you in the program.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: So happy to be here, Chris. Thank you.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: I want to start really broad. I just read this really interesting, I think it was a speech you gave or is it essay about the TikTok fight, which I want to get to in a second. But even before the specifics of the TikTok fight, I wanted to talk about at the broadest level, a thing that I’ve been wrestling with in my generational cohort. And I think we’re broadly similar cohorts, which is I used to be really excited about technology.</p><p class="">I used to really think like I was at first like Wired magazine subscriber generation. I convinced my parents to ditch AOL and get like an ISP. And I was like had Mosaic and I was on the internet early and it was mind blowing and explosive. I had the first iPhone. And every new technology seemed promising and cool to me. And now every new technology seems desperately scary. And I don’t know if I’m just getting older or not, but you’re so connected to all this and think so deeply about this. Like, do you feel the same way as someone who lives in it?</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Well, you are getting older. I’m getting older, too, but I don’t think that’s the reason. I think the answer to that question is complicated and it boils down to an answer that’s not really about tech, but more about the business models that we organize tech within and the incentives of the people who currently have the power to decide what tech gets built and who it serves.</p><p class="">So I have actually spent a lot of time over the last year or so going back to the archives and reading a lot of the debates in the 1990s, the legislative proposals, the different civil society actions and what have you, that were informing the conversation on how what they called the internet or the information superhighway or cyberspace was going to be commercialized. Because we had a big moment in the ‘90s where the Clinton administration had, you know, determined that the internet was a big platform for them and they were going to rest a lot of promises of economic prosperity on the idea of this commercial internet.</p><p class="">So I’ll fast forward through that, but basically what happened is the neoliberal consensus, which was very alive in the ‘90s, and that’s a fancy word that means basically we trust the market for everything and we deeply distrust government, it determines, and the Clinton administration codified that, that platforms or internet companies would not have any restrictions on privacy and endorsed very explicitly surveillance or advertising as the business model. And this was, of course, important to the advertising industry who didn’t want to lose another source of revenue.</p><p class="">You know, they supported newspapers. They supported a lot of other media. They didn’t want another media platform that wouldn’t have, you know, them involved. But that combination effectively created this incentive structure for mass surveillance as the economic engine of the tech industry, because on the one hand, you have no restrictions on privacy so commercial surveillance can go well beyond what a government can legally collect and create about citizens.</p><p class="">And on the other hand, you have advertisement as the revenue source. And of course, you know, what do advertisers want? They want to know their customers and they want to reach the people who are going to buy the thing that they are selling. So the more information you gather on the subjects, the better for advertising, or at least that’s the theory. And I think that really set in place the cornerstones that created the collateral consequences we’re living now, where we have a handful of large, you know, surveillance driven tech companies located largely in California that are controlling core infrastructures and platforms and media services for populations across the globe.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Part of what I keep coming back to because you talk about the ‘90s is the reason that this sort of question of the model, the business model and the market mechanics, as opposed to the tech itself, is a really important one, is that we live through a period where we went from this very commercialized internet to a more open internet. So the sort of gated community walled garden of Prodigy, CompuServe and AOL, and you would go on one of these services and everything was sort of in this universe, right? It was exploded by the open internet.</p><p class="">And there was this moment where it felt like we had moved from essentially platform dominance, AOL, CompuServe and Prodigy to something far more open. Anyone could go to anyone’s website. I could respond to you. There are all these open protocols. And then now to go back into a world in which everything seems so platform dominated, I think because I had the experience of watching it go from closed to open back to closed, I have this very tangible sense of what’s lost.</p><p class="">Like every time that someone wants me to download one of their apps, I’m like, no, the whole point of the internet is that I don’t have to download your goddamn app. I could just go to your website to make a reservation or whatever. We figured this out. Why are we moving backwards?</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Yeah, I mean, I completely agree, and again, I think we’re around the same generation. So I did have an experience of getting on all the message boards and the blogs and, you know, having a very well populated RSS feed. And now you’re living through what is sort of, you know, trash feeds and bot armies. It feels pretty devastating in some ways.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yeah.\xa0</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: You know, I think that kind of open close dynamic is a tricky one, in part because, you know, what we were talking about was openly available protocols or standards, right? But they still were gated on the ability to pay for the servers, to pay for the bandwidth, to set up the material infrastructure.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Totally.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: So there’s a way that we confused everyone being able to do it if they could afford it and had the skills for a sort of democratic equity --</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yeah, great point.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: -- which was not what we were dealing with. And I think, again, really feeds into some of the consequences we’re living through now because, you know, we left that wide open for capture and monopolization.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yeah, this is a really important point just to stay here for a second, which is some of the sort of halcyon days that I often recall, it’s a much smaller percentage of people online. It’s a much more elite, way more white male, and it’s very more like tech nerds focused. And so in that little universe, if you had a high degree of disposable income, could pay for a computer and a good internet connection, had tech knowledge, some of it you can code a little bit, then it was like this utopian open protocol you could do everyone. But this is a tiny little sliver. This was not a mass phenomenon and it’s important to check myself on that because it wasn’t really small D democratic in any broader sense, even if it felt that way to the little community that was involved in.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Yeah, I mean, it was certainly fun for us, right?</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yeah. Right. Yeah.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: And I think that, you know, there were also community networks that were being built where there were new structures of, you know, a kind of micro social wage contributing to supporting the network infrastructure. Like there were models that were trialed, you know, in the ‘80s and ‘90s. It was simply that there was a huge amount of pressure from the advertising and tech industries to codify this very particular form of, you know, surveillance advertising or ultimately what became surveillance advertising as the commercial engine. I should note, you know, Matthew Crane is the scholar that I reference a lot for this. So people interested in this history should look up his work.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yeah, he’s great. I’ve been reading him for the book that I’m working on, which brings me to the question of Signal, which I want to start with just because I was just writing about Signal in the last chapter of this book I’m writing about, which is about attention. And one of the things I was writing about when we talk about physical metaphors all the time, you know, the information superhighway or surfing the web, right, these different physical metaphors. You know, one of them is that like we move through public and private spaces all the time in real life, like some spaces are commercial and some are not. Some are publicly held, some are privately held.</p><p class="">Increasingly, the internet is all commercially held, like you’re always in a mall or you’re always in someone’s building, you know, Meta’s building or, you know, Musk’s building or whatever. And one of the things that is fascinating to me about Signal is it’s a place you can go on the internet. It’s a protocol and an app that you can use that is non-commercial.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Yeah.\xa0</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: And just the idea of that, like it’s amazing how little of that there is. It’s just a non-commercial app. But just explain the basics of the philosophy and how it works that you’re running this app that is not there to make money.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Yeah. Well, I mean, that is a deep choice for us. It wasn’t simply that we thought, hey, being a nonprofit is a virtuous corporate model. Let’s adopt it to be virtuous. It was really based on an understanding that the business model in tech is monetizing surveillance. And if you want to focus seriously on privacy, which requires, you know, not adopting that business model, not monetizing data you collect either through training AI models or selling ads or what have you, then you cannot be pressured by commercial incentives to put profit and growth above that mission, which is ultimately what a commercial entity is bound to do.</p><p class="">You have certain objectives that you need to meet and those involve revenue and growth and you promise your board. And then if you’re not meeting those, you’re going to have to meet them somehow. So privacy would always be subtended to those objectives. And so being a nonprofit was really important for Signal as a prophylactic to push back on any possibility of pressure, you know, to commercialize and thus to adopt a surveillance business model and whittle away the promises we make to people who really do rely on Signal for life or death situations when digital security is linked to physical safety.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Can you say a little bit more about that or just what Signal offers its users and what the app does?</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Yeah. So Signal is the largest truly private messaging app in the world. We have tens and tens and tens of millions of users at any given time, and we are committed to collecting and creating as little data about people who use Signal as possible. So our threat model, which is how we think about, you know, threats, I guess it’s a security term, but is really to even view ourselves as an adversary. So we can’t access the data, which means if someone comes with a subpoena or a warrant, we can give them very, very little.</p><p class="">The sum total of what we have is we know that a given phone number uses Signal. It’s a messenger app. You have to register with the phone number. We know when that phone number registered for Signal. We know the last time they logged in, but we know nothing else. So unlike Meta or Apple or others, we can’t give your contact list. We can’t give your profile photo. We can’t give the members of your groups. We can’t say when you contacted whom and, you know, how many conversations we had. We don’t know what you said or when.</p><p class="">And all of that, you can imagine, is incredibly sensitive information for, say, dissidents or people doing human rights work and authoritarian regimes, people organizing labor unions, you know, journalists talking with their sources, whistleblowers, et cetera.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: That’s what I use it for. Yeah. Yeah.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yeah.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: So it’s a core infrastructure for dissent and privacy. And I think it’s really important to note that, you know, Signal has something really special that no other competitor has in the truly private messaging space, which is that we have huge adoption around the world. And of course, a messenger, a communications network doesn’t work if your friends don’t use it. You can be deeply ideologically committed to privacy and, you know, you can’t really use Signal if you don’t have a friend on it, right? So, you know, that we are very committed to maintaining the app at a standard and a kind of usability.</p><p class="">That means, yes, the ideological purists can adopt it, but also their dad can adopt it, you know, their mom, you know, their landscaper, you know, whatever other human being who may have other commitments, but nonetheless can pick it up and use it easily when it’s really important and, you know, when they just want to talk about something casual.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: And I want to just come back around to what you said at the beginning and re-hit the point for folks that are not embedded in this conversation about tech, right, which is that that information about your users, all the data that comes with them, right, who they’re connected to, mapping them, you can use it to map them, you could geolocate, you could figure out what their social networks look like, what kind of person, what kind of things they might want to buy, what their interests are, politics.\xa0</p><p class="">All that data around them is both a threat to their privacy, but also is commercially valuable. In fact, it’s the main commercial value of these folks to a platform, which is why to go back to the original thing, choosing to be non-commercial means that you aren’t driven by the desire to take that data and monetize it because that’s the inevitable incentive structure of the current commercialized internet is to do that.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Yeah, beautifully put. And it means, you know, in brass tacks, it means I don’t have some guy on my board when we have a quarterly meeting who’s like, you know, you’re not meeting revenue targets and we really need to consider this privacy thing. Is it actually working out right? Like that would be the real pressure we would face. And at some point we would have to choose profit or privacy. If we were for profit, we would obviously choose profit.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: There’s ways in which the commercialization even come back to the surveillance stuff, but just continue with this trend of the commercialized internet in its 2024 form and why it feels crappy. You know, even outside of the surveillance question, like the spamification of the internet is to me so intense these days. It feels like it’s the ratio of Signal to noise is getting out of whack, things I want to see and things I don’t want to see. It feels like just spam. It feels like it’s a spam.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Nudes and bio everywhere.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yeah, exactly. Right. Yeah, nudes and bio, exactly. And, you know, that to me also is a little bit of part of the way the commercial internet functions. I mean, even just Google as a product to me has gotten worse. I know you worked at Google, if I’m not mistaken, at some point in your career.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Yeah, for a long time.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yeah, for a while. They seem like they’re spamming their own users more and more and partly that feels to me like people having those quarterly meetings of revenue and it’s like, instead of three sponsor links, what if we went to five instead of five? Instead of five, what if we went to seven? And it’s like, okay, but at a certain point you’re now spamming me and I can’t use Google anymore. So something’s wrong here.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Yeah. And, you know, the reality that Google was built for an open web where they were crawling it and indexing content, you know, for better or for worse, and there’s a lot of worse. And now there’s not that much to crawl, right?</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Right.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: You’re talking about paywalls. You know, not paywalls for crawling, but you know, you’re talking about walled gardens. You can’t link out to a Facebook post from a Google result. So I think it’s a combination of just the real way a corporation works, where every director is in some petty fiefdom trying to make sure that they’re working on the hot new things so that they can get their OKRs met, so that they can get their promotion so that whatever, whatever, right. Like there’s a lot of just sort of petty self-interest that tracks to different broad incentives.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Well, it also strikes me, and Signal’s an app that I use and really like. I wonder if we’re at a tipping point where the user experience is degrading such that it starts to take a toll commercially, right. That you’re juicing revenue through all these different means of selling your users data or essentially my obsession is their attention, right. What you’re doing with their attention and spamming them, right? Abusing their attention, right, as opposed to conserving it.</p><p class="">You use Google because it conserves your attention. The thing that made it so great was I need to focus my attention on the thing I want to know and you provide that to me. Once you start abusing my attention and wasting it, the value proposition of the product has declined. And it seems to me like that even commercial equation for the customer has changed in all kinds of parts of the internet where I wonder if it starts to have commercial consequences. You know, they’re going to lose users and --</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: And use losers actually.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: And use losers. They also do that. It’s true. There’s going to be bad commercial consequences, even in the own sort of neoliberal terms of how all this is structured.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: I think that is right. I think it’s hard to measure that for a number of reasons, in part because we’re dealing now with infrastructures that we often don’t really have a choice to use, right? What is the alternative to Google in a world where encyclopedias are out of businesses. Libraries are now closing on weekends because they’re defunded.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Right.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: I think there is a way that the users would love to go somewhere else. Where else is there? And this gets back to why there’s only one Signal, right? There’s only one, you know, non-profit, non-commercial, mass private messaging service. And there are very, very few non-profit, non-commercial tech endeavors that actually build tech at scale. It’s because it’s incredibly expensive.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: That’s the point.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: And it’s incredibly expensive.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: And you just gave me my next question, right?</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Yeah. Well, we’re just vibing right now because we’re on the same page. But, you know, I’ll just say Signal costs around $50 million a year to develop and maintain. And so there’s a weird split you know, when I say that number.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Wow.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: All the non-profit people are like WTF. That is so much money.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yeah.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: All the tech people are like, whoa, you are --</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: That’s nothing.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: -- so lean, right?</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Right. Yeah, correct.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: So, you know, we’re dealing with a paradigm --</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yeah. Yeah.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: -- that is so capital intensive. And how is it able to be so capital intensive? Because that surveillance business model that has been developed by these, you know, network monopolies is very, very profitable.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: More of our conversation after this quick break.</p><p class="">(ADVERTISEMENT)</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Can we talk a little bit more about the surveillance model because one of the things I think about the surveillance model is it doesn’t actually work that well. This is one of the great, to me, scams of the modern internet is ad tech. You know, the idea is you have this incredibly granular sense of who your customers are and I know that you’re Chris Hayes and you live in Brooklyn and you like these things and you like to work out and you like basketball and you have your dad and, you know, you’re into politics or whatever it is. And so I can sell you these things.</p><p class="">And there’s some level that that’s true. Like my Instagram feed shows me some dumb gadget to buy from my home gym. Totally. Yes. And then I buy it because it’s like you got me. But a lot of it doesn’t work. And also, it doesn’t seem to actually remember when I bought a thing that it doesn’t have to keep advertising it to me.</p><p class="">And I’m just not clear that, like, there’s this vision of it as all this, like, amazingly efficient machine of we surveil you. We take your information and we sell it to advertisers who sell you exactly what you want. And it actually all feels incredibly schlocky to me and like pretty kludgy, like it’s not actually operating with the degree of sophistication that it’s, quote unquote, supposed to.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: You know, I think that is largely correct. And I think what it does do well is sort of it has captive audiences, right?</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yeah.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: So if you spam a billion people with something, a handful of them are going to click. Maybe one of their kids is going to accidentally kind of, you know, move through some Venmo flow and buy something. You know, occasionally there’s something cute on Instagram and I’m like sluggish enough to buy it, right? But it’s not, you know, that the ads on Twitter actually kind of make me happy and that I feel so anonymous when I’m advertised like a, you know, like I love shamrocks, St. Patty’s Day, extra-large T-shirt. And I’m like, you just do not know me, do you?</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Right. That’s my point.\xa0</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Thank you.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Really, exactly. But it’s funny to me how often that’s the case and also how I guess what I would say is that I didn’t think that the cutting edge of internet commerce would feel like infomercials on a Saturday morning in 1984, which is what they all feel like. It doesn’t feel like slick and glossy. It feels like just a sea of schlock is what it’s being used to sell.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Remember, like the AOL homepage from back in the day --</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Right.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: -- when you were like a kid in the ‘90s and you were just like, whoa, I can’t pay attention to anything. Everything is flashing and glowing. And, you know, it feels very similar and I think Tim Wong, who is a researcher, wrote a really lovely little book a couple of years ago called “The Subprime Attention Economy,” which was, you know --</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: I love that book.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: -- looking at this --</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yeah, I love that book.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: -- at this very issue. I don’t want to dismiss the kind of effectiveness of this out of hand, because I do think the power here is the ability, correctly or not, to begin to segment people, like classify them into different categories and then make guesses about, you know, Meredith, lady in New York does a lot of yoga. She’s maybe going to like this, you know, Pilates mat or, you know, whatever it is.</p><p class="">But of course, you know, that’s kind of trying to influence different set, you know, create different segments and then try to sort of order them and influence them. And I think it, you know, we don’t see behind the scenes on how easily those objectives are met. I do think, you know, the one thing that this, you know, the revival of neural networks that happened in the early 2010s did is begin to sort of probabilistically determine those segments. Like that’s why AI got popular is because these surveillance companies were like, oh, dang, we have the data and we have the compute and we can now make these old probabilistic techniques to do new things.</p><p class="">And you know what that’s useful for? That’s useful for sort of building heuristics around ad targeting. That’s useful for crafting engagement driven algorithms. I think it’s not a, you know, coincidence that there was a big announcement kind of guilelessly made about Google Brain Team who had come out of the lab and into the real world of Google doing this ML stuff after kind of Jeff Dean had pushed forward a couple of advances. And they were like, we are redoing the YouTube algorithm.</p><p class="">And that was right around the same time you started to get all the problems of like, hey, why am I watching a, you know, a lecture by a feminist philosopher? And then I’m being recommended Jordan Peterson on auto play, right?</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Right.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: And so, you know, I think they’re trashy. I think they are broadly inaccurate, but I think the ability to sort of probabilistically create categories into which you situate people and then to sort of sort them and order them and try to influence behavior based on those categories is something we need to take seriously as a, you know, a bad thing to have in the hands of a few corporate actors who are, you know, broadly unregulated and, you know, well, they are regulated, but not nearly enough. And of course, there’s no federal privacy law in the U.S.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yeah, I mean, I totally agree. I think there’s an interesting intellectual debate between the Shoshana Zuboff vision of this, which wrote this book “Surveillance Capitalism.”</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: And the Tim Wong vision of it, which I think is just an interesting one. In some ways, it’s an empirical one, like how well does this stuff work? But that point about segmentation, this is something I’m pretty obsessed with, that the segmentation for consumer marketing to me is less problematic than what it does to like the public realm in the broadest sense of democratic discourse, which is to just completely fracture and balkanize it in a way that’s opaque.</p><p class="">So if you’re reading the “National Review” and I’m reading “The Nation,” right, well, at the very least, we could swap magazines.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Right.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: In some ways, it’s transparent what was published in “The National Review” that you might have read and what was published in “The Nation” that I read (ph), you know, a left-leaning publication, or right-leaning publication. The black box opacity of the algorithm is like, I don’t frickin’ know what you’re seeing. You don’t know what I’m seeing. No one knows what anyone else is seeing.</p><p class="">I mean, in the specific sense of what thing after another, there’s one video that you can say, well, that has one million views. But the specific sense of what information is a person being fed over time, I find it so unnerving that there’s no actual definitive answer --</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: -- that it’s all just a black box.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Yeah. Yes. Period. Exactly. And it’s a black box that is, again, heuristically determined by a handful of companies to maximize engagement in order to maximize ad revenue. So it’s not, you know, there’s no balanced diet here. We’re just being fed Skittles.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yeah. Yeah.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: And I also think we do need to mention the role of these platforms in hollowing out the possibility for those two physical magazines sitting on a table together. There’s, you know, the decimation --</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Destroyed. It’s destroyed all of, yeah.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Of local media, of, you know, even, you know, anything but the like handful of large media houses that the FT, “Wall Street Journal,” “New York Times,” you know, we don’t wear the practices and journalistic norms and ethics that undergirded for the state are all but hollowed out.</p><p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"></p><p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"></p><p class="">And I have this experience frequently of being on Twitter and, you know, some guy will quote tweet me and I’ll look at who it is and I’ve never heard of this dude before. And he has like twenty five million followers. Like there’s an incredible parallel ecosystem that just does not ever permeate into my world, but is somehow, you know, clearly more persuasive than a lot of what I do follow and know to some people or, you know, at least has, you know, bought a bunch of bots to follow it.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yeah. Nudes in bio.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Nudes in bio.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: So, to me this segues to TikTok nicely, because to me, I want to put aside the question of the forced sale of TikTok or shutting it down if there’s not a for sale and the policy question around that, which you have really interesting and strong feelings on, which I want to talk about. Before we even get to that, just TikTok, claw TikTok (ph). Like, let’s say it was an American company, okay.\xa0</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Let’s say it was American. It doesn’t matter. As a technology, it feels really unnerving to me as like a kind of apex predator. There’s a <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691160887/addiction-by-design" target="_blank">great book about slot machines</a> by a sociologist named Natasha Dow Schull. And it basically is about how they kind of outcompete everything else on a casino floor and over the years, they’ve taken up more and more of casino floors because they’re just better at retaining gamblers and making money. They’re sort of the best attentional machine devised. And TikTok feels like that and I actually think the physical scrolling, it’s like a slot machine.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: And I think that’s not an accident. And yeah, it just feels like, you know, fentanyl is to heroin or whatever metaphor you want to use, that it’s just better at retaining attention in a way that others aren’t and it kind of freaks me out how good it is.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Yeah. No, I mean, I feel like actually the sensory overload of walking into a casino or one of those out of time, loud, blaring, flashing environments is my visceral reaction opening TikTok.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yes. It’s very casino like, yes.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Like, damn, who is that person? What are they doing and why are they selling like crystal healing? What is going on with that dance? You know, I have no love for TikTok. I think what they’ve done is sort of take a paradigm that Instagram is trying, YouTube is trying, you know, all the platforms are trying.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Oh, they’re all copying it now, just straight up. Yeah.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Yeah. IV feed, you know. So, yeah, I don’t see great benefits from any of these platforms. In fact, I think, you know, I’ve argued like the platform form itself as sort of centralized overseers and ultimately centralized modes of control over our global information ecosystem is a, you know, really terrifying place to be in, you know, for a number of reasons at this time in the world.</p><p class="">We’re facing imminent climate crisis. We have rising networked authoritarianism around the world. And, you know, the way that good journalism acts as an immune system to some of the kind of authoritarian propaganda, you know, we don’t have that muscle and it’s, you know, almost atrophied completely. So, I have no love for TikTok and I do think there’s something really annoying about it that I can’t really spend much time there or on Instagram anymore. Any of the kind of, you know, the sort of visual feeds.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yeah. Well, the worst feeling is to not like it and still do it, which I think that is the worst feeling and the feeling I think increasingly people feel about the internet, actually, which I think gets it part of the weird situation we’re in. You’ve come out strongly against the legislation that passed the House on a bipartisan sort of very interesting, strange bedfellows, you know, both for it and against it, that would essentially force ByteDance, which is the parent company, to sell TikTok to a purchaser that was not essentially controlled by the Chinese government.</p><p class="">And you think this is a very bad idea. Just to put my cards on the table, I feel like I’m a swing voter on this or like I’m I feel cross pressured on it. Some arguments in both directions, I find persuasive. So I don’t I don’t have settled opinions. But what is your argument here?</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Yeah, I mean, look, my argument is coming from the perspective of someone who, you know, starts and ends with the conclusion we are in a really bad place and anything we do here is going to be harm reduction, not actually attacking the root cause, right.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Right.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: You know, my position is these platforms should not exist in their current form and they’re, you know, dangerous to democracy. They are dangerous to journalism. They’re just simply too tempting for any centralized government to try to manipulate and control for us to keep them around in their current form. But, you know, the argument on the TikTok ban in particular has a couple of points. One, there’s a lot of noise being made about privacy and about TikTok being, you know, kind of the vector for the Chinese state into data gathering on U.S. citizens, I see no evidence that TikTok offers special access, right.</p><p class="">There are thousands of data brokers across the world and, you know, a number based in the U.S. that, you know, Chinese operatives can access. You know, there is way, way too much data out there. And that I don’t see that as a barrier to entry and I’ve seen no evidence, right. You know, people will kind of gesture to like if you had classified information. And I see that as kind of a NatSec red herring in this case, given my understanding of how these platforms work.</p><p class="">I also think that, you know, this is clearly a protectionist policy, even if it is also a NatSec policy in good faith, which, you know, for some it may be. But I think there’s a real concern I have, particularly as we face the very likely possibility of a Trump presidency that is right now preparing to gut the administrative state pool, all power in the executive branch, you know, that would be ready on day one to issue a federal abortion ban, like real drastic measures that you may or may not agree with.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Right.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: But nonetheless, I think, you know, a government in waiting that is preparing to pull that much power under the presidency, you know, to be ushering in a ban that gives the president the power to determine a platform is, you know, foreign adversary controlled gives them a really big stick to discipline any platform in the world such that it complies with certain mandates on acceptable speech and expression.</p><p class="">And that gets to the, you know, the kind of uncomfortable third point, which is that we’re already living in a time where in many states, access to LGBTQ resources are banned and criminalized. We’re seeing books being banned. We’re seeing pedagogy that engages race and racism. We’re seeing access to abortion resources banned. So those become, you know, when we think about harmful content or, you know, off limits speech, which, you know, there’s obviously, you know, child exploitation and other things really do fall into that category.</p><p class="">We’re seeing a move that is very intentional and very well organized to include a lot more expression into that bucket. And I think it’s concerning to me that that is happening at the same time that we’re seeing a full frontal campaign to bring every platform under U.S. jurisdiction. So, you don’t have the benefit even of a kind of cross jurisdictional agonism where maybe the Chinese state doesn’t care about our ability to access LGBTQ resources.</p><p class="">So there is at least a way to access them there, even as the U.S. state, you know, is clamping down on Meta and what have you. And look, I recognize all of this is very hypothetical. You know, I can’t prove that this is what’s going to happen. But I also think the stakes are so high that it is irresponsible for me as an executive, you know, thinking about these issues and leading Signal not to take them very seriously and prepare for them.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: We’ll be right back after we take this quick break.</p><p class="">(ADVERTISEMENT)</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: So this point that my understanding is the way the legislation works is the president deems, because it’s not specifically TikTok, right --</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: -- it’s that the president can deem a network or a platform whatever.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Foreign adversary, which is like China, Iran, Russia, North Korea right now. So, you know, the classic slate.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yeah. Although that’s moved around a little bit.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: I know. I was like, wait, what was the ‘90s --</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yeah. It wasn’t the access of e-mail, right? China got in there. So, yes, that there’s something ominous about the power that gives the president to make that determination, particularly in the context of imagining Donald Trump wielding it as a tool of discipline for disciplining networks.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Right.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Right.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: And we recognize that there is a deep tradition of almost total deference in the courts to the executive branch when it comes to matters of national security.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Right. Yeah, I find that pretty persuasive. I mean, to me, the best argument isn’t the privacy one. It is actually just the mercantilist trade one, which is like, look, if you can’t sell a Ford car in China, then China can’t sell cars here. And actually, that’s kind of how it works with cars right now. And like, you know, if Facebook can’t operate there, they can’t run TikTok here. Like now it’s very different, a car and a platform because it implicates speech and information and democracy in a way that a car doesn’t.</p><p class="">But that argument, I think, is a decent one. It is not like hysterical, is just much more clear eyed and more honest. Like they don’t let us sell our cars there. We won’t let them sell their cars here.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Yeah. And I think, like, let’s just put ourselves in the shoes of a European watching that and like, huh, which one do we want because we don’t have any (inaudible). Right?\xa0</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: We don’t have any, right. That’s a great point.\xa0</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Because there’s only, you know, the top four platforms by our U.S. based TikTok is way behind YouTube and WhatsApp and Instagram. So we’re talking about the U.S. having control over the platforms that constitute a global information ecosystem, not simply the U.S. So I think, you know, yes, if we’re just going to put our blinkers on and look at, you know, like tit for tat kind of trade issues, that’s a kind of metaphorical way to understand this. But I think the stakes obviously redound well beyond —</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yeah.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: --- are we driving a Ford or a I don’t know the name of a Chinese car company because they can’t sell them here but I’m sure they’re --</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Exactly, but they’re very good and very cheap, very successful.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Yeah, I would probably drive one.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: At some point that’s going to fall apart, actually, which is sort of next interesting frontier. So let’s talk about AI because you also have been thinking about AI for a very long time, involved in AI discourse. The place I want to start is just I feel torn. I have two conflicting impulses on AI right now. One is that like, oh, it’s very clearly a pretty impressive technology. And when we say AI, large language models that are useful to produce things that sound like humans, I guess would be one way of thinking about it, right.</p><p class="">That can do the kinds of knowledge work that only humans can do until very recently. Like, please read this chapter and summarize its main points for me. Couldn’t get a computer to do that two years ago, really. And now you kind of can. There’s a whole bunch of other things. Read this brief and try to write a brief that’s a counter response to it. Five years ago, it’d be very hard to get someone a computer to do that. Now, a computer can do it and like, it’s not bad.</p><p class="">So at one level, I’m like, yeah, this is an obviously serious, real technology with real impacts and could be enormously revolutionary. And then also the rush that everybody, just the gold rush feel of it has a very crypto feel to me where I’m like, is this just some nonsense bubble? And I feel conflicted because with crypto, I basically never got the use case. It never seemed like a useful technology to me other than for the purpose of paying ransom. Like that was like the one actual use case for it. Whereas AI doesn’t feel that way. AI feels like a real technology with enormous potential and use cases and also a very frothy bubble around it right now. Help me figure out how to feel.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Yeah, I mean, there’s a lot going on. You know, I mean, it’s certainly a bubble, you know, not all bubbles pop and crash and go away, but all bubbles do pop at some point, right. The dotcom bubble pops and then sort of cemented the ad tech, you know, the surveillance advertising industry in its wake.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: How useful do you think the technology is?</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: To do what? And that’s really like summarize a brief?</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yeah, to do a lot of the quote, unquote knowledge work that a lot of essentially what we call white collar professionals are paid to do, which is to generate marketing memos and to read briefs and write response briefs or to come up with an ad campaign for a product, you know, all that sort of stuff.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: So I think it can write an e-mail prompt. An e-mail prompt is probably like fine if you’re sending an e-mail and no one reads an e-mail anyway so you just have bots prompting each other forever, right. You know, it can come up with a marketing memo, but you’ll definitely need to get an intern to correct it because it’s going to be boring and anodyne.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Right.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: It can summarize a brief, but like you better not be my lawyer.\xa0</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Right.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Because that summary is very likely to be wrong.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Right.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Very likely to miss key nuance. And a real issue here is it’s not accurate. It is not trustworthy for any domain where facts actually matter. And that I want to contrast to the fact that it is so expensive, right. We’re talking hundred million dollars to do one training run of, you know, one of these advanced models. There’s kind of discussion, a billion dollar training runs.</p><p class="">And that doesn’t even get into the cost of the labor required to basically tame these systems into some sort of form that will produce, you know, effectively like kind of acceptable liberal discourse that isn’t spewing slurs or otherwise, you know, making it unsafe to use in your chatbot business or whatever.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Right.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: And then it costs a lot to run. So running one of these is much more computationally intensive than like a regular information retrieval search query. So we’re talking about a really expensive set of technologies that only a handful of companies actually have the resources to produce and use. And we’re talking about that like, okay, is that worth it for an e-mail prompt?</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Right.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Is it actually? Like is that actually going to be a return on investment? Is there a problem big enough that this solves that it’s actually worth all the money? And so that’s where I see the bubble crashing down.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Okay, so that actually clarified this for the first time and I feel like I understand because that actually syncs up the two things that are in tension, which is the float of all the money rushing in is obscuring the resource cost. Like the reason that it seems because you could just go to ChatGPT and like mess around and be like, do this, do that. And it’s like, wow, this is kind of cool. I had it write a stand-up comedy routine in the voice of Ulysses S. Grant about the Battle of Vicksburg and it was like pretty good.</p><p class="">But whatever that costs, electricity, computing power, all that is completely hidden because of how much money is rushing in so that no one’s paying an actual price for it. It’s a little like, you know, it’s like Uber before Uber had to be profitable where, it’s like, oh, I just I went 25 miles for $7 like this work.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: It’s sort of doing that right now is what you’re saying.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Yes. And, you know, we have to see ChatGPT as an advertisement that Microsoft is running a very, very expensive advertisement that does two things. One, it marketed Microsoft as an AI leader, which it certainly was not considered before it ran that ChatGPT ad. And two, it’s a really good ad for their GPT APIs, which they sell as part of their Azure cloud services, right.</p><p class="">So, you know, they’re saying you could play with GPT. It costs us, you know, $100 million a year to run ChatGPT because we’re having to pay for all the compute and we’re having to maintain the system. But, you know, what that’s really doing is that luring cloud customers in where we market them like, hey, you should buy access to our GPT services that you can effectively white label for your fake AI startup, which isn’t really building AI. It’s just rewrapping a Microsoft API or an Amazon API or a Google API. So that’s the go to market strategy. Either you go to market through a cloud company --</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Okay.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: -- or you go through to market because you’re Meta and you have a billion users on your platforms and you can just sort of use AI to reach those users, you know, basically to calibrate your ad, you know, advertising systems or, you know, give advertisers new tools or what have you. But there isn’t really another go to market strategy here. So this is why I’ve written with the Amba Kak and Sarah Myers West and others at AI Now that AI is really a big tech technology.</p><p class="">And this is why open AI is bolted onto the side of Microsoft. This is why, you know, Inflection just sort of had a weird, you know, it looks like kind of an acquisition, not quite an acquisition. </p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Didn’t Microsoft steal their CEO or something?</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: It was super weird. It was like their CEO and then most of the staff, and then there’s some investor payment coming. But basically it looks like Microsoft is sort of buying their model so they’ll now be able to, you know, you can license an Inflection API through Azure. You can license an open AI model, you know, GPT model through Azure. You can license a Mistral model through Azure, right. But ultimately, like the business model of these startups is to bolt themselves on to one of the big companies because there’s no other way to go to market.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: And that’s because the computing power you need is so intensive.</p><p class="">Yeah. You know, it’s so intensive and you don’t have the cloud businesses and the economies of scale, right. Microsoft has data centers across the world with, you know, hundreds of thousands of SREs maintaining those --</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: What are SREs?</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Site Reliability Engineers. Sorry. It’s like, you know, like they’re the guys who are like making sure the servers run at the low level. And then you have like DevOps who are crawling through the server rooms, like getting the rat out of the --</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Right.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: -- tunnel that like mess up the wiring, all that. You know, it’s expensive.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: There’s actual physical infrastructure here and a ton of it and it’s extremely power intensive, which is there’s a “Times” article about how all this is coming online. It needs 24/7 power. It’s pushing power consumption up at a time when we’re in a very precarious situation because we’re doing this kind of grid transition to lower carbon energy. So there’s that part of it, too.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: And then, I mean, it’s four times more power intensive to run a data center with GPUs, which is the AI chip that, you know, at this point, than it is with CPUs, which is what everyone was using.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Wow.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: So you’re having to retrofit these data centers for these sort of hyperscale compute environments. And, you know, Northern Virginia recently said we cannot accept any more data centers unless they bring their own power source because Dominion Energy, which supplies their grid, doesn’t have the power. So it’s, you know, we’re hitting hard caps here. And again, I want to go back to this sort of only go to market strategy because no one else has the sort of cloud business model or the global reach.</p><p class="">So, you know, if I want to stand up a global app, I want it to get to users everywhere. I want that to be high availability and have, you know, the features like video sharing and all of this stuff that takes a huge amount of bandwidth and you need your servers proximate to your users or it’s going to round trip around the globe, and then we wouldn’t be able to be having this conversation.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Right.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: It’s Microsoft, Google and Amazon have 70 percent of that market followed by some Chinese companies, right. So you don’t have the opportunity. You know, you can’t just do that yourself if you are any other smaller company.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Okay. Again, I’m a little slow here, but what I’m hearing is that --</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Well, I talk fast.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: What you’re saying is in a tech world that is already dominated by giants, that it is conveniently the case that this technology is the most favorable to massive, well-resourced incumbents. And it’s probably not an accident, the enthusiasm for this technology by same well-resourced massive incumbents, because they’re aware that this is not like a technology where there’s like some upstart that’s going to upend things. But they see it as a means of consolidating further their sort of massive incumbency.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Yeah, exactly. And, you know, it’s a really good narrative. So, you know, I think it’s important just a little bit of the history here.</p><p class="">So there’s a paper in 2012 that basically kind of like launched AI machine learning, whatever, onto the scene. You know, basically it showed that you could use these GPUs, these powerful parallel processing chips and huge amounts of data via the ImageNet data set, which was scraped from the web, you know, the collateral of the surveillance advertising business model --</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: And human production like cost.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Exactly. And, you know, it was only possible due to Amazon Turk workers. In fact, like Fei-Fei Li says, she was about to abandon creating ImageNet until a grad student told her that, oh, there’s this microtask service. You can get them to label it instead of grad students and it will take less than 100 years.\xa0</p><p class="">So, you know, it’s very contingent. But, you know, this paper showed that techniques that were developed in the late 1980s could do new things when you had compute, huge amounts of compute and huge amounts of data. So it was basically favoring an industry that had already sort of consolidated many of these resources in a way that had no real competition. And I think it’s really notable that when this came out, we weren’t really talking about AI.</p><p class="">We’re talking about machine learning. We’re talking about neural networks. We’re using kind of technical terms of art. But the AI narrative was kind of bolted onto that with the super intelligence, with this idea of building AGI, which I find to be, you know, it’s a really powerful marketing narrative if what you want to do is sell the derivative outputs of your kind of surveillance business model, these models created by the data and the compute as intelligent, as capable of solving problems across a billion different markets from education to health care to, you know, whatever.</p><p class="">So I think we need to trace also the history of that term AI and particularly like how it became favored now and how much benefit we’re giving to these technologies because, you know, we recite the word intelligent when we speak about them.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yeah, I mean, I had <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/why-is-this-happening/unpacking-ai-exponential-disruption-kate-crawford-podcast-transcript-n1304427" target="_blank">a conversation with Kate Crawford</a>, who you and her co-founded a center together, if I’m not mistaken.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Yeah. She’s at Microsoft. Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: At Microsoft, where we talked about the kind of like the magician trick feeling, you know, that like, yeah, it looks like he made it disappear, but it didn’t actually disappear. There’s just a lot of computing power running. I guess I do feel, though, that and I totally understand that history, right, that the surveillance tech model, huge data sets, huge amounts of computing power, you have these two things. Okay, what can you do with them? Okay, you can do large language models.</p><p class="">And that there was something utterly ingenious, right, about the chatbot and the packaging, right, to go back literally to the Turing test, Alan Turing, the sort of one of the original thinkers on artificial intelligence. And his test is, can you interact with artificial intelligence, a robot and not know that it’s a robot, not know that it’s a computer? And to go back to the Turing test and come up with, you know, a chatbot that you interact with and does uncannily feel like something’s on the other side of it.</p><p class="">I guess my question is, so then what next? Like your view on this is that it’s pretty cynical and that it’s sort of mostly marketing mumbo jumbo to repackage a set of resources and business advantages that already existed. But it also seems to me like it’s maybe it won’t. I guess maybe what you’re saying is not actually that useful in the end, but isn’t it going to get better and then be really useful?</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: It is useful, but it’s not necessarily useful to all of us, right? I think, you know, you can look at the writer’s strike and see who it’s useful for and who it may threaten, right. It doesn’t, you know --</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yes, I mean, that’s the worry.</p><p class="">Meredith Whittaker: Replace a human being, right. We know that the scripts it produces are going to be like worse than the worst Netflix dreck, right. And that it will still require human writers with sensitivity and ingenuity to get in there and rewrite that script because it’s going to be just trash unless they do. But it does allow the studios to give those, you know, people who used to be called writers the title of, you know, editorial assistant, hire them through some gig platform and degrade the skill that they put into that, right.</p><p class="">So I think, you know, again, these are really neat. But given, you know, the centralized nature of the resources required, given the cost and given, you know, what they’re actually good at, which is, I think, you know, they’re very good surveillance techniques, right. AI as a, you know, a surveillance, you know, it’s very good in military techniques. It’s very good in employee surveillance, right.</p><p class="">But it’s not necessarily good at things that are, you know, particularly beneficial for the many. You know, I do think we’re going to have to do a lot of pruning of this very weedy garden of claims and hype and really get down to, like, what problem does this actually solve? While keeping in mind that the issue is not necessarily the tech itself, it’s how the structures that create it are shaped, the corporations and the governments that have the ability to determine who it serves and who it subjects.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Meredith Whitaker is president of Signal app. She’s also co-founder and chief advisor to the AI Now Institute.

When we entered the Treasury building on the first days of the Biden administration, you know, we were coming off a long period of underfunding for the IRS and that translates in the American experience into a lot of bad things.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Hello and welcome to “Why Is This Happening?” with me, your host, Chris Hayes.</p><p class="">Well, we are here for another edition of this year’s special campaign franchise for WITHpod, “WITHpod 2024: The Stakes,” in which we take a look at the policy records as president of each of the two major party nominees. This year for the first time, since 1892, we have two men running against each other who both served as president, which means they both have records on policy issues. You don’t have to just listen to the campaign rhetoric. You can actually look at what they’ve done.</p><p class="">And today, we’re going to talk about one of the most important things that the government does. One of the most contested sites of distribution, redistribution. One of the materially most important areas of policy, and that is tax policy.</p><p class="">I think it’s fair to say that both of these men have very different views of taxes and what taxes are for, but we can compare what they actually did. And today I thought it’d be a good idea to talk to someone who’s an expert in this.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing is the Eric M. Zolt Chair in Tax Law and Policy at the UCLA School of Law and she actually served in government. She was the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Tax Analysis in the U.S. Department of the Treasury, served as the lead economist in the Office of Tax Policy during the first part of the Biden administration.</p><p class="">Kimberly, welcome to the program.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Thanks so much for having me.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: So the setup here is, you know, the first time since 1892, two presidents, two people running against each other, both with records. It’s not speculative. What would they do with taxes? Well, they’ve done stuff with taxes.</p><p class="">So I think the neatest way to divide this into sort of four quadrants, right? So Trump and Biden. And for each of them, I think legislation and then enforcement. So the things that you can only do through legislation, which is things that you sign into law and then things that you do through things like the Treasury Department that don’t necessarily require, but enforcement priorities and things like that.</p><p class="">So let’s just start with Donald Trump. And I think the easiest way to start would be on the one big piece of domestic legislation that he got signed, which was the big Trump tax cuts. What was in the Trump tax cuts?</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah. So, the Trump tax cuts had two major components, a permanent component, which were large corporate tax cuts. They took the statutory rate down 14 percentage points and did a number of things around the tax base as well, but ultimately reduced corporate taxes as a share of GDP to being one of the lowest in the world, really, for the United States.</p><p class="">And the second pillar was a bunch of individual tax cuts. Those are all set to expire at the end of 2025. But those include rate cuts. They include pass-through business income cuts, which are felt on the individual side and estate tax cuts that benefited about two in a thousand estates, the richest two in a thousand.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Two in a thousand. Wait, two out of 1,000 estates?</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yes. So if you’re in the top two tenths of 1% of American estates, then you benefited from the fact that the exemption for the estate tax increased to twice its value. So now there’s about $25 million you can pass on to your heirs if you’re a couple without any tax obligation, where it used to be half that.</p><p class="">So those are the big individual side things. Those are all expiring at the end of 2025. So one of the things that candidate Trump has suggested he would do if re-elected is extend all of those tax cuts. In fact, at some points he talks about doubling down on them and doing even more tax cuts beyond that.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yeah. So, let’s just talk about the individual cuts. So the estate tax, W. Bush did this, too. This is a weird idea fix in Republican policy circles. Even though it’s, I mean, not even though because it’s obvious, because extremely wealthy people who give a lot of money benefit from this, so it’s not like that much rocket science, but tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny slivers of folks so that they can get more money tax free left to them when their parents pass away, basically.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: That’s correct, yeah. So, it’s a little unclear why that’s captured the imagination of the political people who aren’t among the super wealthy. Like why is it that people might vote against, you know, the estate tax is perplexing, a sense it’s such a vanishingly small chance that you would ever have to pay it. So it does seem like something that you would think voters would be in support of letting expire this big estate tax cut.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: I remember the last time that we had the exact same thing, which is that a big estate tax exemption was put in the Bush tax cuts. It was also temporary. They always do this so that the deficit scoring in the 10-year window is lower.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yes.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: So if you have them expire, it brings down what the score of the total amount that it bust the deficit is. This happened under George W. Bush and I remember Paul Krugman writing a very funny column on what he called the “Throw Momma From The Train” incentive structure, which is that --</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: -- if someone passes away --</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: That’s right.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: -- before the expiration, that like twice as much of the estate could be passed on tax free, which creates some obviously very perverse incentives.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah. It was particularly weird in that case because the estate tax changed gradually and then it disappeared for one year and then it was reinstated as a --</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Oh, that’s right. It disappeared for one year.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: -- much higher level, so you did have this perverse incentive to die in a particular window of time. This one is a little less dramatic than that and it is true that it will, you know, affect maybe one in a thousand estates on the margin. But you have to remember that there’s another slice of the super rich, who probably wouldn’t even feel the difference between those two exemptions because most of it is so wildly north of that.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Right, yeah. If it’s billions of dollars, the exemption.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yeah. Okay, so that’s one part. Who benefited from the rate cuts that might expire?</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah. So the interesting thing about the rate cuts is you might think, well, the top bracket is really the only one that benefits the rich. But if you look at the entire rate structure, because we have a marginal tax rate system, you know, some of your income is going to be taxed at every rate.</p><p class="">For instance, in my case, I have some that’s taxed, but it’s not taxed at all because there’s a big deduction. Then there’s some in the bottom bracket and then there’s some --</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Right.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: -- in the next highest bracket and you kind of go up the bracket. And because of that structure, when you change the brackets, you’re really benefiting disproportionately those at the top of the distribution, even if you’re talking about some of the lower brackets, because the lower brackets, if you’re above them, you get the entirety of the lower bracket at that cut.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Oh, I see.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: So you might think, well, this is easy. You’ll just extend the ones below some dollar amount and don’t extend the ones above it, but you’ll still be disproportionately helping the well-off if you take that approach.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Right. Because everyone who’s wealthy pays in those lower brackets. But --</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yes, all of it. Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: -- right, but not the other way around. So you’re getting whatever the gains are beneath you no matter what.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: That’s right.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: And then there were other things they did.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yes.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: So the estate tax, the rate cuts, I mean, there was a bunch of stuff. They threw a bunch of things in there.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: There’s a bunch of stuff. I think one of the most troubling provisions was the pass-through business deduction.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yeah, explain that to me.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah. If you look at that, what it is it sort of says if you’ve got income coming into your individual tax return in business form, which could be partnerships or sole proprietorships or other types of business income that aren’t in C corporate form, but that end up on your individual tax return. If you’re in some industries, but not on others, you get a 20 percent deduction.</p><p class="">So this is kind of an odd incentive that favors some industries over others that is very regressive, because if you look at the benefits from this, a majority of the benefits go to the top 1 percent and the bottom half of the population, I think, only gets 3 percent of the tax cuts. So it’s very, very skewed toward the top. It’s very complex and it’s distortionary.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Why do they do this?</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Along with the corporate tax cuts, there was an idea to say, okay, well, what if your business isn’t in C corp form, you should get something too, right?</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Oh, it sounds like dealing in some group of people.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah. And so that happened, you know, not at the beginning of the legislative process, but kind of as people started to realize that, well, what about so-called small businesses who are often very wealthy people, but who aren’t in C corp form, they should get something too. And that’s very expensive, it’s about a half trillion dollars to extend that.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Half trillion?</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah, over 10 years. Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: That’s a huge tax cut.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: So it’s a $50 billion a year tax cut for a relatively small group of people that are relatively well-off, is that fair?</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah, I think that’s fair. I mean, of course, there’s going to be some people lower in the income distribution who benefit from it too. You know, like if you have a Uber driver or a salon provider, right?</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yep.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: They may also --</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yep.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: -- get pass-through income deductions, but it’s a complicated provision. I think there are better ways to, you know, redirect resources to people lower in the income distribution who have business activity than to give like this huge windfall across the board.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: So let’s talk about the corporate tax part of it, which is not temporary. It’s permanent. Although, --</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Right.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Donald Trump has said he <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/team-trump-eyes-even-corporate-tax-breaks-dems-pounce-rcna104611" target="_blank">wants more corporate tax cuts</a>. When you step back and you look at tax policy through the years, that corporate tax cut was enormous. It’s a huge amount of money and corporations are a difficult thing to conceptualize. Like, what does that mean? Who does it go to? Well, it goes to the shareholders. Well, who holds the shares?</p><p class="">Well, teachers and pensioners. But, you know, okay, sure. But are they really seeing the benefit? Like, first of all, describe how big the cut was and what are the effects of it?</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah. So the cut was from 35 percent statutory rate to a 21 percent statutory rate. But one thing to bear in mind is that the biggest companies are really not paying at the statutory rate, in part because they’re operating throughout the world and they can easily arrange their financial affairs, so a lot of the income ends up offshore at a lower tax rate.</p><p class="">But if you look at sort of what it did to taxes received as a share of GDP, we were averaging about 2 percent of corporate taxes as a share of GDP and that fell to the neighborhood of 1 percent due to this agreement. And if you look at the typical rich country, they bring in more like 3 percent --</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Wow.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: -- of the GDP in corporate taxes. Our corporations are some of the most successful ones in the world. If you look at any list of like the world’s top corporations, U.S. has a dominant place on these lists and it disproportionately so relative to the size of our economy. So it seems particularly odd for us to decide to collect so little corporate tax revenue.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: More of our conversation after this quick break.</p><p class="">(ADVERTISEMENT)</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: There was an argument that was made that sort of went this way, we had one of the highest statutory rates in the world. Other countries, who have lower, even ones we think of as like social democratic countries like France or whatever, now they have very different, complicated and layered tax structures, so they use a bunch of different taxing strategies. Obviously, taxes, a percentage of GDP are much higher in those countries.</p><p class="">But the argument went like this, we have a high statutory rate. The high statutory rate incentivizes gaming the system. I think Apple declaring a bunch of profits in Ireland, because it was sort of a tax haven, all sorts of Caribbean tax havens. If we bring the rate down, that will get rid of distortions. It will incentivize actually corporations paying. I don’t know how much good faith was behind that argument, but that was the most high-minded argument other than we would like to cut an enormous check --</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah. Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: -- to the owners of capital in America.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah. No, I agree that that argument is important. I think what gets lost in that argument is that if your competitor is a country with a zero corporate tax rate, taking it from 35 to 20 isn’t going to really dampen a lot the incentive to go to zero. So in fairness, what the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act did, and that’s the name of that legislation, is it did have a minimum tax that applied to foreign income.</p><p class="">But the way it was designed, together with other provisions that were in the same legislation, meant that it really wasn’t solving that profit shifting problem. It was kind of making it worse with one hand and better with the other. And on net, when you look at the data, there was still just as much offshore income after Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as there was before. There was very little diminution in this problem.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: So that’s what I was going to say. We have the results now.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: I mean, there’s a theory about how it would work.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: But the results are that it didn’t do that. It didn’t bring profits back on shore.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: That’s right, yeah. I mean, you can find a couple of companies and there’s some marquee tech companies that did move some things off back. But if you look at the aggregate data for the economy as a whole, the pattern looks really similar across the years.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: So what we know is that argument didn’t, in the aggregate, pan out. The rate really did fall. And crucially, if you just don’t look at the rate, what percentage of taxes, corporate tax per GDP, which is the actual number, right, relative to the size of the economy, fell in half. So relative to the size of our economy, we’re collecting half as much from corporations. What does that mean? Who benefits from that? Again, it all feels very obscure.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah. So I think economists agree that the corporate tax is one of the more progressive taxes we have in our tax system. There’s a little bit of disagreement about does labor pays some of it, you know. Because we might think, for instance, as you mentioned, there might be people who have shares in their retirement portfolios, but there also might be effects on the capital stock that trickle into people’s wages.</p><p class="">So there may be some effect on labor. We don’t think it’s necessarily zero, but it’s a much smaller effect than you would get from other tax instruments. So if you take your labor income tax, if you take your payroll tax, if you take sales taxes, all of these taxes, labor is entirely burdened by they pay every cent of those taxes.</p><p class="">So even if the corporate tax falls in some measure on labor, which it does a little bit, most of it is falling on capital and on above normal returns to capital. And so it does reach those types of income, which we’re often not taxing at all at the individual level. We’re just completely avoiding taxing it at the individual level. So it’s really our only bite at capital income and so taking so much less tax revenue in that area really reduces the progressivity and fairness of our tax system.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: I’m just going to translate that like wealthy people who own a lot of stuff.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: That’s right, yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: I mean, that’s owners of capital.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Right.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: If you have big stock portfolio, you have a lot of money, it disproportionately helps them. It would disproportionately favor them. There was a reason that corporate America, as a whole, loved this bill and pushed very hard for it. And they were able to get the votes for it because it was an enormous boon. I mean, a real material improvement to their bottom lines across the board, both in an institutional sense, if you’re, say, Apple. But also in the individual sense, if you’re someone who has $15 million in your portfolio and $5 million of it is Apple stock.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: That’s right. And you see this a bit in the run up in the stock market in the year of that legislation as it gets more and more likely that it’s going to happen. You see the stock market really rising. You see it in big surge in buybacks, record buybacks after the legislation and so the data really confirm your story there.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: So that’s the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, that’s a big piece of legislation. It’s the only big piece of legislation. I think the distributional story fairly consistent across these different areas. Like it might have been at the margins decent for all kinds of different people, but by and large, the target of its largesse were the people with the most money.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: That’s right.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: It benefited the wealthiest the most by far.</p><p class="">Let’s talk about enforcement. You know, this is another place where taxes really matter, how much the IRS is doing, who they’re going after, how much they’re making sure people are paying their taxes. You worked in the Department of Treasury under Biden. Again, this is complicated stuff. There’s literally thousands of civil servants. The IRS is its own sort of weirdly quasi independent body in some ways, as it kind of --</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: -- should be there’s commissioners. But how would you give a top line for the Trump administration’s approach to that?</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah. So, I think the Trump administration continued sort of a longstanding lack of interest in adequately funding the IRS and the tax service in general. When we entered the Treasury building on the first days of the Biden administration, you know, we were coming off a long period of underfunding for the IRS and that translates in the American experience into a lot of bad things for honest taxpayers. It means it’s hard to file your returns. They’re not going to be processed quickly. It means no one’s going to answer the phone if you have a question. It means audits aren’t going to be targeted well, because there’s not the technology to try to tell the difference between honest and dishonest people, so they’re just going to be throwing darts and that’s going to make it more likely that honest people get audited.</p><p class="">And it means that effectively the people who are paying their taxes in full, which is the vast majority of all Americans pay them at full out of their wage income and there’s reporting on that, they’re going to be bearing the burden of funding government services, while those who have opaque sources of income, who choose not to pay in full have a competitive advantage in the marketplace against their competitors, but also are getting away with a much lighter tax burden.</p><p class="">So there’s a big fairness issue here, too.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yeah. If you’re a teacher and you get into W-2 at the end of the year, --</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: -- and you have one source of income, which is your salary, the government knows exactly what you made.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: It’s got the form and it deducted.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah, exactly.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: There might be reasons that you get money back, depending on some other things about your household, about how the deductions line up. Like, there’s nothing you can really hide, like, they know. The school system told them and that’s true for --</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: -- most workers. Your boss told them exactly how much they paid you. If you have some different vehicles for your income and you’ve got investment capital that you’re then borrowing against and that investment capital is growing, but then you’re borrowing like the more money you are and the further you get from just what is like normie wage income, the more gaming you can do and the more complex your taxes get.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Absolutely, yeah. And you’ve hit on a huge thing here, which is that this isn’t spread evenly throughout the income distribution. The people who have these opaque sources of income are well-off. And so underfunding, the IRS really serves the interest of dishonest people at the top, rather than your typical worker who would benefit from being able to get their questions answered and getting their returns processed in a quick way.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: I mean, again, this is a story that’s more than Trump, I should say and a lot of it rests on Congress.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Oh, yes, for sure.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: And Jesse Eisinger at ProPublica and others have done great reporting. We’ve actually <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/can-we-tax-rich-jesse-eisinger-explains-ncna970581" target="_blank">done a podcast on this</a> that over the years defunding the IRS became a goal of, particularly, Republicans in Congress and were very successful in kind of hollowing out the institutional capacity. We saw a distributional skew in audits, more and more focused to people at the lowest part of the income bracket, including those who get the earned income tax credit.</p><p class="">So like, --</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: -- the poorest folks getting disproportionately audited, which is completely bonkers, rich people getting audited less and less. And partly that was because it was easier to do with less person power. So that was sort of the status quo before the Biden administration. There have been huge changes to the IRS in the Biden administration and to tax enforcement and maybe this is a good place to pivot to that. What has changed in the Biden administration?</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah, so there was a really hard fought effort to get the IRS the resources they needed. This includes both through the typical appropriations process, but importantly, also a big increase in funding that was part of the Inflation Reduction Act that was passed in mid-2022. And if you look at the size of that funding injection, it looks very large, but a lot of it is sort of making up for lost ground in prior years, reductions in the ability of the IRS to do their job, but also investing in things like modernization.</p><p class="">Like if you looked at the IRS, they were relying on ancient equipment, old computing languages. They didn’t have, you know, any of the tools that they really needed to do their job. So this surge in funding enabled them to kind of make up for lost time in terms of all the shortfalls before, but also to give them the technology and tools so that they can maybe have a shot at auditing a complicated situation and not just in earned income tax recipient.</p><p class="">Because part of the problem with being underfunded is you have to focus on things that, you know, basic tax adjusters can look at. You can’t look at the really complicated things. Because looking at the complicated things means that you need higher wage accountants --</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Right.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: -- and people that would be harder to hire. So that also distorts our enforcement.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Enforcement has ratcheted up. I mean, I think wait times have gone down. I think there’s a bunch of metrics that show that response times have really gone down, how long people wait on the phone, how quickly they can get someone. So all that stuff you’re talking about institutional capacity, I think that the numbers bear out that that has translated.</p><p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"></p><p class="">But it’s also the case that like my understanding of the numbers are that more rich people aren’t getting audited.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah. And I think there was a deliberate policy goal of focusing more audit attentions on the groups that had been under audited and completely neglected because of all of this underfunding. So I don’t think you or I or most wage workers would see an increase in audits. And in fact, I think the policy intention has been very clear not to have an increase in audits relative to historic levels for ordinary people.</p><p class="">But to make up for some of this big decline that’s been happening in decades prior where well-off people were able to get away with very little scrutiny. And I think that’s important, not so much only because of the people that you target in this audit, but partly because of the signal it sends to people about behavior. And there can be large deterrence effects associated with the idea that there’s a positive probability. It’s not zero, but there’s some chance that people will hold you to the letter of the law and that’s going to make people more compliant.</p><p class="">And so you don’t have to audit someone to get them to pay their taxes, but you do have to make them think that they might be audited in some world, right? And if they lose the faith, they might be audited in some world, they’re probably going to behave in a less proper way with respect to their tax filings when they have discretion.</p><p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"></p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yeah. I mean, one of the themes of this series is to try to be very concrete about what government does and doesn’t do and what these two governments have done and where people’s material interests might lie. And I will say that anecdotally, people in finance are getting audited a lot more, sources (ph) and people I know, and they hate it. And they hate Joe Biden because of it.</p><p class="">And again, this is one of these things where I’m sort of like, yeah, man. I wouldn’t like to be audited. I’m sure that’s unpleasant. And this is an actual policy goal and however you feel about that. But the point is that it has been an actual policy change. There have been resources. There is more focus on people at the very top with these more bespoke forms of income portfolios.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah. And I think if those people, hopefully your friends, are honestly paying what’s due, and auditing doesn’t have to be all that horrible.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: I only have honest friends.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah, but I do think it serves their ultimate interests to collect some of the tax gap. Like if you look at how much we’re failing to collect, it’s hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars a year, right? And everybody’s taxes can be lower if we can fill up some of that tax gap. And if we deter people from wildly understating their income and that ultimately will hopefully make your friends pay less in tax if we can get some of the tax cheats to pay their fair share.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: We’ll be right back after we take this quick break.</p><p class="">(ADVERTISEMENT)</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: So let’s talk about tax policy here. There was a piece the other day, I forget where it was, in the Times or Wall Street Journal, about the fact that, you know, Biden has been a net tax cutter in his time in office. It’s also the case, I saw some interesting polling the other day that Biden and Democrats have no disadvantage on taxes, which was interesting to me because so much of the Reagan level conservatism was what we call the tax revolt. It was about taxes --</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: -- on liberals and that liberals want to raise your taxes, and conservatives want to cut them, and Democrats raise, and conservatives and Republicans cut. And that was, you know, a real political advantage for Republicans for a very long time. Taxes are not particularly high salience, interestingly, right now in people when they talk about the economy, which sort of includes taxes. They talk about immigration. They talk about democracy and abortion.</p><p class="">But there was a period of time where you asked people this question, like taxes qua taxes would be up at the top.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Remember there’s the American Rescue Plan. There’s the Inflation Reduction Act. There’s a bipartisan infrastructure bill, which I don’t think did a ton on the tax side, although it had to do some for pay-fors. Overall, how would you describe the sort of tax policy side of the law under President Joe Biden?</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah. So I think one thing that your commentary points out is that taxes as a whole are a good issue for him. And I think that’s in part because Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is the legislation we talked about earlier was immensely unpopular.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yeah.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Like people didn’t like it when you cut taxes on those that were better off than them. And many people mistakenly thought that they had their taxes increase in part because their relative tax cut was smaller, right?</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Well, I had mine increase, it was not a mistake. The SALT deduction was a --</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Oh, that’s real. Yeah. Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: -- real punch in the face from the Republican Congress.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: And that was quite salient to a lot of people.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: It sure was.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: So Biden as you know entered office during COVID and kind of during the height of it. You know, like it wasn’t brand new, but Congress was still passing legislation to respond to it. And the first major legislation that was passed was the American Rescue Plan. And that invested in a lot of different responses, including healthcare stuff, including sending money to the states.</p><p class="">But it also changed tax rates for two types of people in a really noticeable way. It expanded the earned income tax credit, which helps workers at the bottom of the distribution by giving them a negative tax rate, effectively. And it made that negative tax rate slightly more generous, but more generous in a way that was really perceptible to some people during that period.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Let me stop you right there.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah, yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Negative tax rate, just because that’s a counterintuitive concept.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah, yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: The government gives you money.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: That’s right.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yes.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: So like, let’s say you’re a parent with a couple of kids, right? And your first dollar, instead of paying the government some marginal tax rate, you’ll get, you know, 30 some cents back. And so that helps alleviate poverty and provides an incentive for labor force participation. So it’s a really useful tax instrument and I think it legitimately had some support, historically, on both the right and the left, but I think the Democrats have been more keen to expand it.</p><p class="">And the child tax credit was also expanded in a really noticeable way. It was made more generous. It was made payable in a monthly fashion rather than annually. And it was made particularly generous for especially young children who are often more expensive because of child care expenses and there were also improvements in the child care tax credit as well.</p><p class="">So that really invested in children in a noticeable way and drove child poverty down a lot.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yeah. We cut it in half, I think, 50 percent.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yes.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Let’s stay on the child tax credit because it expired after a year.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yes.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Again, that phrase, it’s just like I can feel myself like starting to like drift off midway through the phrase and also --</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: -- it feels like opaque, like child tax credit.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: What does that mean? What is the child tax credit?</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah. Well, at its most generous level, it was $3,600 a year for young children.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: That the government gives you back.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: It gives, yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yeah.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: So they just send you $300 a month for having a kid, a young child.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Okay, this is a clearer way.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Because one of the things that is very difficult about this is because we do all this stuff through the tax code, right?</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Right.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: And everything happens through the tax code where there’s pluses and minuses on the ledger.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yes.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: And some things are fully refundable credits and some things are not, right? So some things is you can’t get below zero, right?</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: There are certain things where you can reduce your tax liability down, but you can never cross over to the government actually giving you money, right?</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yes.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: That’s how some things work.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Then there’s a whole other category of things that don’t work that way, where the government can actually give you money. The earned income tax credit is one of them. The child tax credit is another.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yes.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: So to simplify here, because I think it’s really important for people to understand this, that like a tax credit sounds like a $300 check to families with children per child.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Okay, yes.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah, or $3,600 every year if it’s a young child and I think it’s $250 if it’s an older child. And it was perhaps a mistake to make it temporary.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Clearly.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Because I think that the hope was that it would be so wildly popular that people would rush to extend it and we’d find money to pay for that at that time. But unfortunately, the generosity of the American Rescue Plan version of it did expire. And as it expired, child poverty then increased by a similar amount that it fell.</p><p class="">So it’s a really nice policy experiment for demonstrating the tools that we have to address child poverty. We’ve got this really powerful tool. We know it works. Now, we just need to get the will to use it. And that’s high on the Biden agenda for a second term.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: So those two programs were expanded. One, the earned income tax credit part of it is still operational, right? The expanded EITC, or did that go away, too?</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: There’s still an EITC, but the more generous version also expired.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Expired, okay.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: No, there’s a bunch of tax implications to the Inflation Reduction Act as well.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yes, indeed. So, the Inflation Reduction Act did two types of reductions in costs for Americans. One is change some of the healthcare rules. This isn’t on the tax side, but in ways that would lower prescription drug costs and other healthcare costs for Americans. And another was addressing energy costs and it did this by investing in clean energy. Right? The main goal here was to have a real climate change mitigation strategy that went beyond platitudes involved to actual action.</p><p class="">So there was a whole array of tax cuts for individuals and businesses that we’re investing in clean energy. And so that could be you buying an electric vehicle. It could be somebody installing solar panels, but it also was meant to be much more involved in sort of the electrification of the economy as a whole. Investing in wind, investing in solar, preserving the nuclear power that we do have.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yup.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Investing in new technologies like sustainable aviation fuel and hydrogen. All of this was meant to be a big response to climate change, but one that, again, is operating through the tax code for the same reason that you might have alluded to earlier, which is that this has to be passed through reconciliation. So you need to do it on the tax side.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: I was just going to say that, right?</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: So just so people remember in the Senate --</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: -- the sort of evolution of the de facto filibuster, which itself is a fairly modern creation, creates a 60 vote threshold for all legislation. There is a once a year you can pass one piece of legislation through what’s called reconciliation, which is, well, usually one. Sometimes you can get away with two, but basically one that only has a 50-vote threshold, but it has to be germane to the budget, which means --</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: That’s right.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: -- all policy has to be funneled through taxing, basically.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: That’s right.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: And taxing and spending has to be a budget bill. And things that don’t connect to the budget can be ruled non-germane. They don’t get in. So what you end up with is the climate portion of the Inflation Reduction Act, which is a huge portion, is a tax set of tax packages. It’s a bunch of tax credits and tax incentives that cut taxes and reduce the cost for everyone from consumers to businesses, to investors and everyone that’s, that’s either purchasing or trying to invest into generate more clean energy.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Exactly. Yeah. And that was the strategy. And, you know, you could imagine, for instance, passing a bill that would simply require the electricity sector to use clean energy, but absent the budgetary impact, you would need a filibuster proof number of senators, right? So it was important to design it in a way that worked through the system that way.</p><p class="">There were also some tax increases in that legislation, too.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yup.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: But those were narrowly focused in the corporate sector on the corporate alternative minimum tax. So that raised a few hundred billion dollars on companies that were reporting a lot of profit but not paying a lot of tax. And then there was a stock buybacks tax too, that also had a small. It was a 1 percent tax on transactions when companies would buy back their own stock.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: And companies buying back their own stock are a way of increasing shareholder wealth, right?</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: It’s like a dividend, but not a dividend because the value that’s transferred is not taxable, right? I mean, that’s the whole trick of it, do I have that right?</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Well, it kind of depends. So let’s say you’re buying back some stock. The person who’s actually selling it may trigger capital gains tax, but other shareholders could just hold their shares and decide not to sell. And then they would see the value of their stock rise. So it sort of gives people a moment of discretion where they can either just hold their stock and see its price go up or they can sell it.</p><p class="">But that could trigger in some hands capital gains tax, although it depends on who’s selling it. If it’s a non-taxable entity, then you don’t have to worry about that.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: I mean, to step back broadly here, we saw under Donald Trump in tax policy, there were some tax cuts across the board in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but much more focused on corporations, which are owners of capital and shareholders, people at the top, the very, very wealthiest estate holders, people that have pass-through income from businesses, focusing on them.</p><p class="">There were, we should note, in the CARES Act and the COVID relief, there were tax cuts, temporary tax cuts for lots of Americans. In fact, you know --</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yes. Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: -- tax rebates, that legislation, which was, you know, written basically by Senate Democrats. Well, it was basically was written by Steve Mnuchin and Nancy Pelosi in equal measure. We should note, it did have big tax cuts for a lot of people and distributionally, I think, was actually quite progressive, wouldn’t you say?</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: I mean, you know, I think there were aspects of that that were quite progressive, like the stimulus payments that were a flat amount, you know, per --</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Right.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: -- individual, so those are certainly progressive. There were some business things in there too, that’s clearly (ph) --</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Oh, yeah. There was a lot of business stuff, too.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: -- were progressive. You know, like, these provisions I’ve written on separately. So it kind of depends on --</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: I missed that.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: -- how you look at it, yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: But distributionally, I think it would be fair to say that generally Joe Biden has focused on raising tax compliance, and tax rates and tax payments for the wealthiest income earners, --</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: -- as well as corporations, and reducing tax burdens at the very bottom, particularly for families and working families.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: That’s right.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: And Donald Trump has pulled off the largest corporate tax cut basically in American history. And an enormous tax cut mostly focused or disproportionately focused on the wealthiest taxpayers.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: That seems right. Yeah. I mean, there were some tax cuts for those at the bottom on average under the Trump administration, --</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Yeah.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: -- but they paled in size to the tax cuts --</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Right.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: -- at the top, not just in absolute size, but as a share of income, they were a much smaller share of much lower income.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Oh, that’s interesting, say it again.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Because, obviously, in actual size, it’s going to be the case that, you know, if you’re making a million dollars --</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah, of course.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: -- it’s going to be much bigger than someone making $10,000 a year or whatever.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Right, right. Right.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: But you’re saying actually is a percentage of income.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Yeah. So you could see that you’d get more like 3 percent of your income back if you’re at the top, but more like 1 percent at the bottom. There’s some nice distributional tables that analyze this from the Tax Policy Center that showed that distribution quite clearly, but they weren’t alone, you know. JCT, Treasury, anyone who’s kind of looked at the distribution of those tax cuts found that they disproportionately increased the after tax share of income for those at the top. So the relative tax cut was bigger as well as the absolute.</p><p class="">Chris Hayes: Kimberly Clausing is the Eric M. Zolt Chair in Tax Law and Policy at the UCLA School of Law. She was the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Tax Analysis at the Department of the Treasury, served as the lead economist in the Office of Tax Policy during the first part of the Biden administration and just helped us walk through the complex thicket of tax policy under the two. Although in the end, the sort of top lines, I think, are fairly straightforward and simple.</p><p class="">Kimberly, thank you so much. That was great.</p><p class="">Kimberly Clausing: Great.

Well before Election Day 2016, most of the party’s elected officials and unelected powerbrokers insisted Trump could be taken <a href="https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/trump_election_delayed_seriously_not_literally.php" target="_blank">“seriously, but not literally.”</a> As his term unfolded, they clung to this fiction like shipwrecked sailors to a battered raft.</p><p class="">Jan. 6 should have shattered that delusion. Yet, as Barr’s comments show, the passage of time has resurrected this belief, and as Election Day nears, more Republicans will likely offer the excuse that Trump’s threats are temporary eruptions of his temper and not an indication of how he’d lead (or rule). But the Trump of 2024 is not the Trump of 2016. The restraints that at times shielded the country from his worst impulses last term won’t be there this time.</p><p class="">Since the night he announced his 2024 campaign, Trump’s third run for the White House has taken a different tone — and not just because he seems to garble his words with increasing frequency. The threats have become more sweeping and more serious. Rallies lionizing the (supposedly) <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/01/22/463884201/trump-champions-the-silent-majority-but-what-does-that-mean-in-2016" target="_blank">“silent majority”</a> have become dark recitals of grievances.</p><p class="">As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/27/magazine/trump-rallies-rhetoric.html" target="_blank">The New York Times’ Charles Homans</a> wrote over the weekend, Trump’s “speeches, and the events that surround them, are about <em>them</em> — what <em>they</em> have done to Trump, and what Trump intends to do in return.” Now he labels his political enemies “vermin.” He warns that immigrants are “poisoning the blood” of the country. He pledges to be a dictator, but only on “day one.” He <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/111434339843310056" target="_blank">promises</a> that “2024 is our final battle. … We will drive out the globalists, we will cast out the Communists, Marxists and Fascists, we will throw off the sick political class that hates our Country.”</p><p class="">In Trump\'s term, chiefs of staff like John Kelly and H.R. McMaster and Cabinet secretaries like Jim Mattis and, yes, Barr himself occasionally staved off Trump’s worst ideas. But, over four years, those who dared to have second thoughts departed, voluntarily or involuntarily. By the end of Trump’s term, loyal lackeys encouraged his every impulse leading to Jan. 6.</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">In fact, not even Barr expects that there will be any guardrails in a new Trump White House.</p></div><p class="">Should Trump be elected again, the country will start from that depth, and only descend from there.

A <a href="https://time.com/6972021/donald-trump-2024-election-interview/" target="_blank">new interview with Time magazine’s Eric Cortellessa</a> finds Trump planning what Cortellessa calls “an imperial presidency.” Trump and his allies float sending troops into liberal cities, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-2025-second-term.html" target="_blank">using the Justice Department to pursue his political enemies</a> and sweeping away checks on presidential power. And there’s no reason to believe anyone will “talk sense into him.”</p><p class="">In fact, not even Barr expects that there will be any guardrails in a new Trump White House. It’s just “my feeling,” he told Collins, “having worked for him and seen him in action. I don’t think he would actually go and kill political rivals and things like that.”</p><p class="">Again, are you not reassured?</p><p class="">Barr isn’t alone in this wishful thinking. Earlier this month, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu insisted that his support for Trump was “not about him as much as it is having a Republican administration — Republican secretaries, Republican rules.” And then there’s the slightly more subtle excuses of Republicans such Sen. Mitch McConnell, who told CBS’ “Face the Nation” that “I’m focusing on turning the Senate Republicans into the majority.” As for restraining the wannabe dictator, apparently someone else will handle that.</p><p class="">As conservative Never Trumper and former Ted Cruz staffer Amanda Carpenter points out, the unspoken incentive for Barr and those like him is the desire to preserve power and influence. “Barr is a Washington operator,” <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/181060/trumps-insane-rant-gutless-bill-barr-unmasks-gop-maga?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=tnr_daily" target="_blank">she told the New Republic’s Greg Sargent</a>, pointing to his new role leading a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/04/13/chamber-commerce-amfree-bill-barr-regulations" target="_blank">conservative alternative to the Chamber of Commerce</a>. “For Trump’s second term, Bill Barr is looking for opportunities again.” The same can be said of McConnell, Sununu and other Republicans who flirted with speaking the truth about the presumptive nominee but are now falling in line.</p><p class="">The irony is that, if Trump wins, these late shows of loyalty may not be enough. Before Barr’s endorsement, Trump called his former attorney general “Weak, Slow Moving, Lethargic, Gutless, and Lazy.” After Barr’s endorsement, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112329627037807609" target="_blank">Trump posted</a>, “I am removing the word \'Lethargic\' from my statement.” For now, though, bowing down may help men like Barr sleep at night, believing that their influence is secure.</p><p class="endmark">If only they were as concerned for the country.</p></div></div></body></html>'}

MSNBC legal analysts Andrew Weissmann and Mary McCord\xa0go deep on\xa0what arguments to pay attention to. This, as the New York trial wraps up a week of testimony from former AMI CEO David Pecker. And an analysis of the latest indictment related to election interference in the 2020 election, this time from Arizona.</p><p class=""><em>Note: This is a rough transcript — please excuse any typos.</em>\xa0</p><p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"></p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Hi, and welcome to “Prosecuting Donald Trump.” It is Friday, April 26. We usually give the time, but I don’t think it’s that necessary. But it is before the 9:30 start of the trial today. So we won’t be covering anything that’s happening today on Friday, but we will be covering a lot of news that happened yesterday. I’m Andrew Weissmann, and I’m here with my wonderful co-host, Mary McCord.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Well, good morning, Andrew. And that’s right. We will spend probably a pretty significant portion of today’s episode talking about the Supreme Court argument yesterday on Donald Trump’s immunity claim made in his federal case being prosecuted in Washington, D.C. by Jack Smith, the special counsel. </p><p class="">That’s the case that charges numerous criminal violations related to the January 6th efforts to prevent the peaceful transfer to power. We will also hit, of course, the highlights from the last few days of testimony in the Manhattan trial. David Pecker has been on the stand pretty much all week and will be on the stand today. </p><p class="">He is, of course, the former CEO of American Media, which ran the “National Enquirer” and other tabloid type magazines. Should we start with some framing of what was in front of the Supreme Court yesterday? And then I’m really anxious to kind of make a few top line points about what I took from the argument. And I’m sure you are, too, Andrew.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. And we have actually not had a chance to talk about it. So I’m dying to hear your take. You know, one of the things that will keep this moving is I have left my venting on MSNBC, where I was sort of on like morning, noon and night yesterday. And so I feel like I’ve sort of expunged that. </p><p class="">Mary McCord: Expunged, the word that the chief used many times yesterday. I think that just got in your head. Expunged, expunged. We’ll get to that.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. I have watched and heard a lot about people’s reactions to the argument. And I think it’s useful to go back to basics as to what was at issue, because I think people are also very fixed on the trial versus what legal standard the court could come up with that could be devastating for this country. </p><p class="">So just Mary, big picture, I’m in a very, very depressed mode because I think this is the decision in terms of what will happen to our democracy. I mean, I know that sounds like pretentious and grandiose, but it’s sometimes the right way to think about something. </p><p class="">Mary McCord: And, you know, that’s on top of a lot of other cases in the Supreme Court that are pretty troubling right now, where the arguments were waiting.\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Absolutely.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: So it’s not just this case. I mean, this case, I think, is really significant, really, really significant. But it’s been a rough several weeks of listening to Supreme Court arguments.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. </p><p class="">Mary McCord: I’d say a rough term. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. And that’s not even if you even go way beyond the sort of Trump related one --</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Exactly.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: -- the disqualification motion, the obstruction decision that we’ve talked about, both of those. But you can obviously go to the end of the --</p><p class="">Mary McCord: EMTALA.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: -- right, EMTALA, the end of the administer state. </p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yep.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: And then, you know, back to Dobbs overturning Roe v. Wade. I mean, it’s just on and on and on. I mean, it’s just incredible. </p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yep. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Anyway, we are digressing. </p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yeah, we digress. Okay.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: So it’s useful to remember that what Donald Trump’s counsel was arguing was that unless and until a president is impeached by the House and convicted in the Senate, he cannot be criminally charged for official acts in office. </p><p class="">Mary McCord: Or things in his words, things done within the outer perimeter official acts. So a very broad, expansive reading of official acts. Yes.\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. That was the second part, which is --</p><p class="">Mary McCord: I’m sorry. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: -- how do you define official acts? Which is it’s the outer perimeter. So very, very broad. So, for instance, if you were presumably engaging in bribery as a president, but you used your office, which is almost necessary for the bribe, he could say, well, that’s within the outer perimeter of his presidential duties. \xa0</p><p class="">So but that’s sort of the devils in the details as to how you defined official acts. But he was basically saying criminal immunity for official acts defined as the outer perimeter of the duties of the presidency, unless and until there is an impeachment for which you are convicted.</p><p class="">No one was arguing, including Donald Trump, that private acts could be subject to criminal immunity. So that’s really important. \xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yep.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: That was not an issue. And the reason I’m sort of framing that is because a lot of our discussion comes back to, oh, look, they could --\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Could get away with murder.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: -- with a win here, could get a win by going forward with private acts. And that’s like that’s a given, that was not argued. Now, there is an issue about what is --</p><p class="">Mary McCord: That’s right. But there’s a devil in the details and let’s come to that, right. Yeah, come to that.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: The devil in the details is what is private, what is outer perimeter and what’s the standard that the court would use? But I think that framing is important. And then what Michael Dreeben was arguing for Jack Smith, and actually he was actually arguing for the solicitor general. </p><p class="">Mary McCord: That’s right. \xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: He made very clear that he was there very much on behalf of the Department of Justice, not just within the special counsel’s office. And he said, because it’s such an important issue, it goes way beyond the issue of just what happened in the special counsel case. And of course, you can’t think of anyone better than Michael Dreeben, given his incredibly long tenure. You and I both know him and have dealt with him, he’s a superb, wonderful lawyer.</p><p class="">But he was arguing that obviously private matters are something you can, of course, be prosecuted for that, again, that was a given. And with respect to official acts, his view was there is a small group of matters within the core, unique functions of the presidency for which a president could not be criminally charged. \xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: And by that, he meant things that are committed to the president by the Constitution, like the pardon power, right? The power to make recognized foreign governments, the power to veto, things that the Constitution gives him directly and explicitly.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: And uniquely. </p><p class="">Mary McCord: And uniquely. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Not shared with other branches. And he said, so leaving that small core group aside where he said there would be immunity. </p><p class="">Mary McCord: He didn’t call it immunity.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Yes.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: He just said that if there was a criminal statute that sort of infringed on those core duties of the president, that is one that would not be able to be prosecuted.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. And whether you call it immunity or whether you say the statute would be unconstitutional as applied to him.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: It’s applied to him.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Absolutely. So then you deal with what do you do with the rest of it? And the position was that for criminal prosecution, that you can have a criminal prosecution for especially when you have public acts, sort of official acts for private gain was the way he kept on sort of phrasing it. </p><p class="">And of course, this indictment now turning to the specifics, he said this indictment obviously doesn’t fall into that small core category. And yes, there are parts of the indictment that are pure private. But even if there’s parts that relate to some official acts --</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Things that he said he used the official trappings of his office to do.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Right, such as you could argue that threatening criminal prosecution to Brad Raffensperger on the tape. This didn’t come up yesterday, but that’s obviously using his official office. </p><p class="">Mary McCord: Well, what did come up?</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: I mean, the threat of it --</p><p class="">Mary McCord: What Michael Dreeben specifically talked about is the content of that call. I just need you to find me -- </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Yes.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: -- 11,000 something votes and change that arguably that call to Raffensperger. Mr. Trump’s attorney says that’s purely official acts. Michael Dreeben did not give that up and agree that was purely official.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Oh, no, of course.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: But he said, you know, you can look at the content of that and see that Mr. Trump was doing that in his capacity as a candidate, not as a holder of the office of the president, which gets us to one way of drawing lines, but at any rate.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. That’s sort of the devil is in the details as what is official, what is not official. But anyway, that’s the setting of the scene and so now let’s talk about the argument. And, Mary, I know you’re loaded for bears. So what did you think? \xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: So I have just sort of three points and then one sort of takeaway. And these are just the overarching things I took from the argument. First is I didn’t see really any appetite from any one of the nine justices for Mr. Trump’s argument that he is absolutely immune from prosecution for anything done within the outer perimeter of official acts, because even Justice Alito said there could be some things that you do as official acts and his example was SEAL Team Six. Ordering SEAL Team Six to murder a political opponent. </p><p class="">He said there are some things that it wouldn’t be plausible to say that they’re legal. And in fact, we can hear exactly what he said about this from the argument. </p><p class="">(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p class="">Justice Samuel Alito: Well, I mean, one might argue that it isn’t plausibly legal to order SEAL Team Six. And I don’t want to slander SEAL Team Six because they are, no seriously, they are honorable officers and they are bound by the uniform code of military justice not to obey unlawful orders. But no, I think one could say that it’s not plausible that that is legal, that that action would be legal. And I’m sure I’ve thought of lots of hypotheticals. I’m sure you’ve thought of lots of hypotheticals where a president could say I’m using an official power and yet the president uses it in an absolutely outrageous manner. \xa0</p><p class="">(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p class="">Mary McCord: So, okay, so you can hear in that clip of even Justice Alito that some things might be just too outrageous, that even if you used official power, they wouldn’t be absolutely mean. So that’s the first takeaway.\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: I just want to say one thing that’s interesting is that doesn’t deal with the text of the Constitution, the history of the Constitution, prior case law, the history of OLC opinions, Office of Legal Counsel opinions, and sort of how the country has actually viewed this in the past and the standard plausible. I mean, that is --</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Right. My point was not that this is a test that I think is going to be the test. My point was I didn’t see an appetite for any of the nine to say you get a free pass for absolutely everything you do that has the trappings of official power on it. Although that is why --\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Alito gets close. \xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yeah. Yeah. But Mr. Trump’s attorney, even with Alito’s hypothetical, wasn’t willing to give that up. So he really does, you know, essentially believe that the Fitzgerald test, the test borrowed from civil laws, the civil cases is the right test, which is if it’s within that outer perimeter, you don’t question it. It gets immunity. </p><p class="">So even his own attorney wasn’t willing to adopt or accept the test that Alito proposed. Okay, so nobody really wants to give complete, absolute immunity to all official acts. The second sort of big takeaway is and this came out time and time again, and I’m going to use little air quotes here, the conservative justices.</p><p class="">And I’m particularly here talking about Gorsuch, Alito and Kavanaugh, because Thomas was quite quiet yesterday. Very few questions. But the other three were very concerned or expressed at least that they were concerned about the chilling effect on presidents if they think they could face criminal prosecution. </p><p class="">Essentially, they were buying in to Mr. Trump’s argument on this, that would chill them from taking bold action that is needed as a president because of concerns that then the next president would prosecute them. And wouldn’t that even lead to every president on the last day of office pardoning themselves for any potential prosecution? </p><p class="">On the flip side, the quote-unquote liberal justices were concerned about if there is criminal immunity for things within the outer perimeter of official acts of a president. Again, with this expansive, expansive reading of official acts, wouldn’t that just essentially turn the presidency into an opportunity to commit all kinds of crimes with a reckless abandon? And in fact, we have another clip from Justice Ketanji Brown-Jackson making this very point. </p><p class="">(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p class="">Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: Also, let me, let me, let me put this worry on the table. If the potential for criminal liability is taken off the table, wouldn’t there be a significant risk that future presidents would be emboldened to commit crimes with abandon while they’re in office? \xa0</p><p class="">(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Wouldn’t you struck, Mary, on that point, because I think that it was almost like a policy debate in Congress. Not --</p><p class="">Mary McCord: But among the justices.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: -- but among the justices where what was missing from that was the text of the Constitution, the intent of the framers, the history of the in the United States. I mean, it was so belied the originalism, textualism credo of the so-called conservative justices. It was completely absent. It was just a policy debate. </p><p class="">And then even within that policy debate, what was missing from the conservative justices was any record support in terms of 200 years of history. You cannot look at 200 years of history and say we really have to come up with a standard for criminal immunity because all hell is breaking loose.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Oh my gosh, yes. Everyone will be chilled. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. And Michael Dreeben made that point. </p><p class="">Mary McCord: That’s right. He basically said our system has worked pretty well. It’s not perfect, but we’ve never had this before, except arguably we had a problem with Nixon. Not arguably. There was a problem with President Nixon and this case. \xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: And by the flip side, when the conservative attack on the response from Dreeben and the so-called liberal justices, which is there are many, many checks in the system already to prevent that from happening, there’s no history.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Layers of protection, he called it, right?</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Right. There’s no history of it, but there are layers of protection. And basically the history shows it’s working. It was remarkable to me the antipathy towards the actual criminal justice system that you were hearing from Alito and Gorsuch, which was Alito saying, you know, you can indict a ham sandwich.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Right. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: I mean, this is our criminal justice system. That is also not true. I understand saying just good faith of people at DOJ is not enough. I totally agree with that. But it is a layer, but it is not sufficient.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yes. Necessary, but not sufficient. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: But to sit there and denigrate the whole grand jury system, you know, I can think of cases where a partisan Department of Justice has sought a criminal prosecution and the grand jury has not gone along. \xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yes.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: And that was during the Trump administration. But there’s more than that. You’re then a criminal defendant with all of the rights that this Supreme Court --</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Has given them.\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: -- has given and other Supreme Courts have given them. And then you have to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. In other words, facts matter. And the denigration of this, including we can’t make a test based on intent and motive because we know how flimsy that is. And we know criminal statutes are vague. I mean --</p><p class="">Mary McCord: You can find a criminal statute to prosecute anybody you want to prosecute, was essentially what some of them seem to be saying. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: And without facts and ignoring the fact that there’s a jury that has to find proof beyond a reasonable doubt unanimously. It was remarkable to me that you had people sitting in the Supreme Court denigrating the entire infrastructure and edifice that of our criminal justice system, that they are a huge part of creating. </p><p class="">Mary McCord: Right. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: And, you know, I teach Fourth Amendment and Fifth Amendment law. The Supreme Court has gone out of its way to be pro law enforcement --\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yes.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: -- in its rulings and very much puts its thumb on the scale. And so suddenly to be, oh, we’re all defense rights --</p><p class="">Mary McCord: In some phases but not all, but yes.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Not all, but there’s a lot -- </p><p class="">Mary McCord: But the point is they rule on major criminal cases every term. They develop the law. The law that is developed in the Supreme Court is what apply to all prosecutors, whether it’s Fourth Amendment, Fifth Amendment, Sixth Amendment. And they seem to be expressing some a lack of faith in the protections that that system provides exactly as you’ve laid out. </p><p class="">I think what else is interesting about those positions, about one group of justices worried about the chilling effect of there not being immunity, the other worried about the emboldening effect of immunity is both seem to suggest that the status quo we’ve had for these 200 something years is different. Like Mr. Trump’s attorney is like our status quo has been that there is immunity.\xa0</p><p class="">And the other side is like, no, our status quo has been that there’s never been immunity. And I thought that was sort of an interesting thing. Now, his point on there’s always been immunity is there has to have always been immunity because it’s never happened that we’ve had a criminal prosecution of a president before.</p><p class="">The other side is there hasn’t been one because nobody’s done anything like what Mr. Trump has done. Okay, my third big point. And then we’ll go to break and come back and talk about it, because I think this is the main sort of where, you know, the rubber meets the road is --</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: The main event.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: -- is there will be a remand for line drawing. And the question is, how will that line be drawn? That line between, as you indicated in the framing, purely private acts that even Mr. Trump’s attorneys agree he could be prosecuted for and whatever other thing, whether it’s core executive functions, whether it’s some level of official acts, whether it’s outer perimeter official acts, whatever that other thing is, where there might be immunity, where’s the line between them? </p><p class="">And I think that’s where most of the argument focused. And I think there’s going to be a lot of dispute and debate between the justices on that, which is why I’m not optimistic that we’ll get a decision until the very end of June or beginning of July. But we can talk about that when we come back from the break.\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Okay. </p><p class="">(ADVERTISEMENT)</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: So, Mary, let’s pick up with your last point about if the Supreme Court sends the case back, remands it for a hearing. \xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: There were lots of different proposals out there in terms of drawing that line. I think one of them that was brought up by justices, both during Mr. Sauer’s argument, he was the attorney representing Mr. Trump and Michael Dreeben’s argument. He was the attorneys we’ve already noted representing the government. </p><p class="">One of the ways of line drawing that kept coming up is the way that had been suggested by the D.C. Circuit in the civil cases brought against Mr. Trump by Capitol Police officers and members of Congress for injuries suffered as a result of January 6th. And in that case, that case called Blassingame. And that name came up throughout the argument. That test was really about it was about immunity from civil prosecution. I’m going to use the word even though we tend to think of prosecution in the criminal sense. \xa0</p><p class="">And because, again, Fitzgerald, this old case we’ve been relying on and talking about for months, says that presidents are immune from civil liability for actions taken within the scope of the outer perimeter of their official acts. So the question in Blassingame is what things were Mr. Trump’s official acts and what things weren’t.</p><p class="">And the way the D.C. Circuit sort of broke it down in Blassingame was whether Mr. Trump was doing something as an office holder or an office seeker. So in other words, was he doing it because he’s the president and this is within the scope of my duties as president? Or was he doing it because he was a candidate and he was doing it because he was running for office? \xa0</p><p class="">And the test they said is you have to look objectively at the whole context. When he is speaking, for example, is he speaking at an event that is a political event that’s paid for by the political party? Or is it an official, you know, U.S. government event where he’s speaking on behalf of the administration, announcing some policy issue or whatever? And you look at other sort of objective, contextual criteria like that to determine whether it’s as a candidate or as the president. </p><p class="">And there were things noted like in the litigation when Mr. Trump went to the Supreme Court back in 2020 over into 2021 to challenge the election fraud, he signed, you know, things as candidate. I mean, it was representative that he was in his position as a litigator, as a candidate. So these are kind of the objective facts you would look at. And so there were a lot of questions about, is that the right test? Is that how we should be applying it? </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: And very much also considering, can you consider, as Justice Gorsuch phrased it, motive as Michael Dreeben phrased it, not motive, but intent and --</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Right and purpose.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: -- and purpose? Yes. And Michael Dreeben was saying that if you are doing something using your public office, but for private gain, that should count in the same way as we talked about. If you are using your public office to coerce Brad Raffensperger to do your bidding, if you’re using your public office to coerce the Department of Justice to say that there is a fraud investigation, that is, of course, you can call the Department of Justice, but you’re entitled to consider what the purpose was, what the goal was, what your intent was. So that very much devil in the details.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Can I just add on your point about Michael Dreeben talking about, you know, you can be using sort of the trappings of your office for private gain? He actually said he thinks in the government’s view, this makes it even worse, right.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Yes.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: It doesn’t make it like more protected as official acts. It makes it even worse and less protected --</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: More criminal, right. Exactly.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: -- and more criminal because you’re using the trappings of your office for private gain. \xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: So that led to sort of a fascinating exchange that I think got everyone all excited in this sort of legal analyst sphere, but I think really has people going down the wrong rabbit hole, which was a very good line of questioning from Amy Coney Barrett, who sort of I think if any justice sort of came off surprising, she did not seem to be buying what Donald Trump’s counsel was advocating. </p><p class="">And she questioned Trump’s counsel about, let me go through some of the key things that are alleged in the indictment and that the governance counsel says are private conduct. Do you agree? And for some of them, he did agree.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: That’s right. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: And so let’s play that. \xa0</p><p class="">(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p class="">Justice Amy Coney Barrett: And I want to know if you agree or disagree about the characterization of these acts as private. Petitioner turned to a private attorney, was willing to spread knowingly false claims of election fraud to spearhead his challenges to the election results. Private?</p><p class="">John Sauer: As alleged. I mean, we dispute the allegation, but that sounds private to me.</p><p class="">Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Of course. Sounds private. Petitioner conspired with another private attorney who caused the filing in court of a verification signed by petitioner that contained false allegations to support a challenge. </p><p class="">John Sauer: That also sounds private.</p><p class="">Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Three private actors, two attorneys, including those mentioned above, and a political consultant helped implement a plan to submit fraudulent slates of presidential electors to obstruct the certification proceeding. And petitioner and a co-conspirator attorney directed that effort. </p><p class="">John Sauer: You read it quickly. I believe that’s private. I don’t want to --\xa0</p><p class="">Justice Amy Coney Barrett: So those acts you would not dispute. Those were private and you wouldn’t raise a claim that they were official.</p><p class="">John Sauer: As characterized. We would say, Your Honor, if I may, that what we would say is official is things like meeting with the Department of Justice to deliberate about who’s going to be the acting attorney general of the United States --</p><p class="">Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Sure.</p><p class="">John Sauer: -- communicating with the American public, communicating with Congress about matters of enormous --</p><p class="">Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Thank you. Thank you. </p><p class="">(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: So obviously, the key there is the concession, because the legal principle of being able to criminally go forward with something that is purely private as we pointed out, was not an issue. So everyone’s like, oh, this is great. They couldn’t rule that you can go forward on private matters. \xa0</p><p class="">Well, that means they’d still be precluding that it all depends on what they view as private versus public. And they would be precluding, at the very least, not evidence, but charges that are viewed as official. So, for instance, the allegations with respect to the Department of Justice are the ones that Michael Dreeben is saying we should be able to use because he’s using his public office --</p><p class="">Mary McCord: For private.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: -- for private gain. But that’s sort of the ballgame. And so, yes, there is a way that this case will proceed because there’s some private matters here, unless the court just says that they even disagree with Trump’s counsel, that they’re private. I don’t think they could go there.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: No.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: So, they’d be able to proceed on the private matters. But that still would be a ruling with respect to public matters and how they describe what is official conduct.</p><p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"></p><p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"></p><p class="">Mary McCord: Official conduct I’d say, rather than public matters. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, yeah, sorry. Yeah. Bad phrasing. So to me, it’s like, yes, there may be a way to go forward with a smaller case. It remains to be seen how much smaller, depending on how they define things. But that’s still a ruling that doesn’t deal with the SEAL Team Six hypothetical, the Justice Kagan hypothetical --</p><p class="">Mary McCord: About a coup.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: -- which is just like Judge Pan about what if the president’s engaging in a coup? That’s obviously something that they could use their trappings of office. </p><p class="">It could be described as official conduct unless Justice Alito is going to say it’s not, quote, “plausible.” I mean, that’s an odd test, to say the least. </p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yeah, I think that is what he would say about a coup, though. But to get back, you know, for our listeners to know what is the ramification of this, right? Amy Comey Barrett specifically sort of said, couldn’t you go forward to Mr. Sauer? Couldn’t the government go forward on these private acts? And then that’s what led to her, as we just heard, going through what private acts are.</p><p class="">So then the question really becomes, can the government still use evidence of things within the official, quote, unquote, “whatever is within the official acts of a president.” I’m going to say using the official trappings as evidence of knowledge and intent to prove up the criminality of the private acts.</p><p class="">As opposed to, as you just indicated, if the court were to say certain official acts are out of bounds or immune, he couldn’t use them to establish criminal liability as to those official acts. But the question becomes, can you use the official acts as evidence? And this is where I think there really is. I think there are five votes for using official acts as evidence.</p><p class="">And I think that primarily because of what the law is and also what just what the chief justice seemed to be pretty adamant about. And he really pushed Mr. Sauer on this because Mr. Sauer’s view was, no, you can’t have any evidence of anything that was done as part of the official acts even come into the trial. And this is where that word expungement came. It all has to be expunged. None of that could come into trial. And the chief really questioned that. And let’s play that clip of the chief. </p><p class="">(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p class="">Chief Justice John Roberts: Well, if you expunge the official part from the indictment, how do you, I mean, that’s like a one-legged stool, right? I mean, giving somebody money isn’t bribery unless you get something in exchange. And if what you get in exchange is to become the ambassador to a particular country, that is official. The appointment that’s within the president’s prerogatives. The unofficial part is I’m going to get a million dollars for it. So if you say you have to expunge the official part, how does that go forward? \xa0</p><p class="">(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p class="">Mary McCord: And the example that the chief was relying on there is that let’s assume that a president promises to make someone an ambassador, given an ambassadorial appointment in exchange for a bribe. A bribe? Do you agree, Mr. Sauer, is a private act? And Mr. Sauer agrees that a bribe itself is unlawful and a president can be charged with bribery. But he did not agree that evidence of the offer to make an ambassadorial appointment would be admissible. His point was like, no, you could only put on evidence of the president receiving the money.\xa0</p><p class="">And I think the chief was rather incredulous to that. Well, how could that be? Doesn’t the government have to be able to tell the story of the reason for the payment of the bribe in order to be able to, you know, go forward with a trial? And the chief justice is right about this, of course. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Of course.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: And so this is where I think to the extent we might be able to have a trial before the election, it’s going to come down to this.\xa0</p><p class="">It’s going to come down to does the Supreme Court say anything about which things are private and which things are public? Or do they completely leave that to Judge Chutkan with some guidance about how she’s supposed to draw this line? And do they say official acts could still come in as evidence of knowledge and intent? \xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: So I agree with you that there were at least five votes for that. But can I just say who disagreed with that point that you just made -- </p><p class="">Mary McCord: Sure. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: -- and that the chief justice was making that makes imminent sense?\xa0 Justice Alito. \xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yeah. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: I mean, he just came right out and said, well, obviously, if you can’t be charged with that, it wouldn’t be meaningful if you could introduce evidence about it.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Right. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: I mean, it was so disheartening to hear that. I mean, it was so disingenuous. I can’t really think of a more favorable word. </p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yeah. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: It was shocking because it’s so obviously wrong. And so just one thing about if it goes back to this sort of a hearing and a decision on sort of official versus private, there is a potential upside. There’s no question that this case could be extremely delayed and that this decision could come out at the end of June and that they’re not going to act quickly and that Judge Chutkan, you know, said that there would be about 81 more days to allow the defense to prepare for a trial. </p><p class="">Mary McCord: Right. But during those 81 days, she could be having the hearing, right? Okay</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Right. That’s my point. Is that if there is a hearing. Just remember, that could be a factual hearing. If you are deciding that’s the sort of the rabbit out of a hat, which is if it goes back for a hearing on this and she thinks she needs to have facts to understand what is official and what is private, you could have a hearing. And I don’t mean like a one day hearing. I mean, you could be telling the government that you don’t have to wait 81 days because it’s not the trial.</p><p class="">No one’s going to jail based on this.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Right.\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: And you could have a hearing where facts get into the record. And as we know, that is exactly what Donald Trump does not want. You can see it from the last thing we’re going to talk about today, which is the trial in Manhattan and David Pecker’s testimony, where there is really, I think, pretty explosive testimony about the nature of what was going on in 2015, ‘16 and ‘17 in that case. </p><p class="">So one thing for people to keep an eye out of, this maybe is my only sliver of optimism, is that there is this ability to potentially have a hearing where people like Mike Pence, Bill Barr, Eric Hirschman, others testify about the facts that would relate to official versus unofficial. </p><p class="">But I do think big picture, I just want to go back to where I sort of started with you, Mary, which is this idea that, oh, but don’t worry, we’re letting you go forward with respect to private acts is a huge loss. I mean, it is true that the definition of private versus official is kind of the ballgame. \xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yes.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: But just remember, Michael Dreeben went in asking for immunity to only be with respect to the core. </p><p class="">Mary McCord: And again, he wouldn’t call it immunity. Gorsuch said, let’s just call it immunity. He’s like, well, okay, but it’s not. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: I’m just doing it as a shorthand. But meaning he’s saying whether he calls it immunity or you can’t be criminally prosecuted because the statute couldn’t reach it. He’s saying that official acts are subject to criminal prosecution. So he would lose on the big ball of wax other than that small core group.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yeah. If that’s where they come out.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Right. </p><p class="">Mary McCord: I do think this whether something’s an immunity or not, does have consequences, though, right. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: It does, yep.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Because if it’s couched as immunity, there’s the opportunity for another appeal like Judge Chutkan rules here. These things are unofficial, private. These things are, you know, official and you’re immune. He can take that up and say she drew the line wrong. </p><p class="">If it’s really all about an as applied challenge to a criminal statute being applied to the president in circumstances where it would infringe on his explicit constitutional responsibilities, that’s not necessarily something that gets you an interlocutory appeal. That is something that you could appeal at the end of a trial. </p><p class="">So, you know, this label, notwithstanding that Justice Gorsuch wanted to just call everything immunity, the label, I think, does have some consequences. And that’s why, to your point, there could be this hearing on these things. It could be that, however, Judge Chutkan rules is something that Mr. Trump would take up again, which means there’s no chance of getting to trial before the election. </p><p class="">But the hearing itself would expose a lot of facts to the public if there was that type of factual hearing. And I’m not 100 percent certain that that’s the kind of hearing it would be, but it’s certainly one possible option. If the government will just say we’re only going to go to trial on the things that Mr. Trump has conceded are private acts and we’re going to put in official conduct as evidence of knowledge and intent, that’s one path to possible trial before the election. </p><p class="">But again, he’s only conceding a few narrow things are private acts. And so if Judge Chutkan went further than that and said more things than that are private, he’s going to at least make an effort to appeal that, I think. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: I agree. So it remains to be seen. I’d say the only other point on this is for everyone to keep their eyes out for what the chief justice is going to do, because people were pretty vocal and pretty clear about where they were coming out. You never know from an oral argument what’s going to happen with respect to the case at large or even certain of the justices. I mean, some were absolutely clear.</p><p class="">But Chief Justice Roberts was surprisingly quiet, I think, on where his leanings were other than the point that you are making, Mary. So it’ll be interesting to see where he comes out. One thing we didn’t briefly discuss is something called the clear statement rule, which was there was a whole back and forth about whether there’s a way to decide this case because the charges couldn’t essentially be brought against the president because the congressional statute didn’t specifically say and this applies to the president.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Only two statutes say that. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Right. Amy Coney Barrett’s like that’s only two out of like thousands of statutes. She’s like, essentially, this is me paraphrasing. She’s like, that’s absurd. \xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yeah.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: I mean, it was very interesting. I mean, she displayed, I thought, just a ton of common sense. </p><p class="">Mary McCord: I thought she had great questions, really important questions.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Yes, and totally great.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: And yeah, I was very impressed with her yesterday. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. And I also thought, once again, Ketanji Brown-Jackson, the newest justice, I find almost like every single thing that came out of her mouth, I was just like, okay, that’s brilliant and grounded in law. </p><p class="">Mary McCord: The other thing we haven’t talked about is, you know, this argument that if there’s anything within official acts that a president could be prosecuted for, it has to be only after impeachment and conviction by the Senate, right. Remember, that’s his core argument --</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Yes.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: -- which sort of defeats a lot of his arguments about immunity, but whatever. We, you know --</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Totally, right. </p><p class="">Mary McCord: But this is another place where Justice Barrett, I thought, was very good. And we do have that clip as well. \xa0</p><p class="">(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)\xa0</p><p class="">Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Okay, so there are many other people who are subject to impeachment, including the nine sitting on this bench. And I don’t think anyone has ever suggested that impeachment would have to be the gateway to criminal prosecution for any of the many other officers subject to impeachment. So why is the president different when the impeachment clause doesn’t say so? \xa0</p><p class="">(END AUDIO CLIP)\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: So with that, let’s go to break and we’ll come back and talk about some other things happening yesterday and over the last few days because this was not the only thing. \xa0</p><p class="">(ADVERTISEMENT)</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: So, Mary, lots of other things going on, although obviously the Supreme Court was a lion’s share of our attention because of what it means for the country, not just for Donald Trump. So, we’re going to focus on two things about New York, what happened in the trial, some not trying to do a TikTok of everything that happened, but just some key points.</p><p class="">Focus on the new gag order motion and then turn to Arizona, where, Mary, I’m going to be fascinated to hear your take because you’ve been so steeped in fake electors and looking into that issue. So David Pecker was on the stand again yesterday for direct and the cross examination started. </p><p class="">And the key sort of big picture is David Pecker clearly was presented by the D.A. as a principal who had an agreement with the other principal, who is the defendant in the case, Donald Trump, very much making Michael Cohen sort of a amanuensis, you know, a staffer, as Nicolle Wallace said, carrying out the work of the two principals.\xa0</p><p class="">David Pecker also sort of explained essentially why Michael Cohen and Donald Trump had to take on a different role with respect to Stormy Daniels. And that is that with respect to the sort of catch and kill scheme and denigrating opponents, they continue to denigrate opponents. The “National Enquirer” did, but with the catch and kill scheme, it’s a couple of things. But basically, “National Enquirer” kept on laying out money. And even with Karen McDougal, they laid out money, but they didn’t get reimbursed.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yeah.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: They didn’t get reimbursed, not because Donald Trump is cheap, but it’s clear, one, they were concerned about --\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Campaign finance violations. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. He basically said it’s so clear. At some point, he’s like, I went and talked to our lawyer and then I came out and we decided we weren’t going to do this anymore. </p><p class="">Mary McCord: He also said, I know about campaign finance violations because I did a similar scheme for Arnold Schwarzenegger back when he was running for office. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Exactly.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: And then I heard from, you know, oh, this could be a campaign violation. \xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: He couldn’t say what the conversation was with counsel because of attorney-client privilege, but it’s clear. It’s like we were planning on getting reimbursed. Then we weren’t. It’s clear that a lawyer is like, what the heck? </p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yeah, that’s right. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: You have a feeling the “National Enquirer” might have been slightly stronger words.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: It might have been, yeah. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: So anyway, that sort of explains why David Pecker then turns to Michael Cohen and says, we’re not doing this anymore. Like, we’re not going to be a bank for paying out.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: They were almost $200,000 in by that time, right? $150,000 for Karen McDougal, $30,000 for Dino Sajudin, the doorman. So, you know, that’s a lot of money. And he said this is way more than they normally pay to kill a story.\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Yes. So this is why Michael Cohen had to take out the home equity loan because the “National Enquirer” was no longer the bank for this. </p><p class="">Mary McCord: Right.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: And so that’s why there was this different way the scheme had to operate. The other parts of the scheme, “National Enquirer” being the eyes and ears, looking for bad stories, denigrating opponents, all of that was still going on.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yes.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: This was just the financial component of the catch and kill. The cross-examination, this is where it helps that you and I have done so many trials because there was a lot of reporting on air that I just violently disagreed with. And that’s because this is the look over here school of cross-examination, which, by the way, I’ve been a defense lawyer. That’s a totally valid type of cross-examination. </p><p class="">But the job of the prosecutors, also the job of the public, and I think our job is to be analytical about what is happening. So the two sort of key cross avenues on this so far were, one, didn’t you engage in this kind of scheme essentially with other people like Arnold Schwarzenegger? Well, that’s not a defense. </p><p class="">The fact that you may have committed an election fraud scheme with somebody else is not a defense to committing an election fraud scheme with a second person. That’s like saying, well, didn’t you commit a bank robbery before? Yeah. Okay, great. That’s true. That’s why I knew it was illegal, to your point, Mary. The second was to say, oh, there’s nothing wrong with just generally doing catch and kill for celebrities. And then there was this sort of salacious list of people who I’m not going to name here. \xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: I was wondering if any of that was public until yesterday. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. I mean, that was basically, oh, we just sort of do this in general for people. But that’s not the charge here. That’s like apples and oranges. The reason we’re here is because of the false business records with the intent to commit a campaign violation. It might be sleazy and disgusting and politically small P bad. </p><p class="">It might open you up if you’re admitting on the stand that you’re deliberately defaming people who are political opponents. That might open you up to civil lawsuits, which, by the way, I was sitting there thinking, oh, my God --</p><p class="">Mary McCord: I know. I was thinking about that too. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: -- the “National Enquirer” has to be like, we just have the head of the organization saying we did this deliberately and these were fake stories. But just saying that you did a non-criminal version of this and we’re sleazy, it’s just irrelevant to this. But they want to make it sound like, oh, it’s just business as usual. </p><p class="">Mary McCord: Business as usual.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: But that’s not the crime. And so, we talked about on our last episode, when opening statements about why you and I looked for smart jurors, just like we’re doing now. You want to be able to just say, okay, that doesn’t make any sense. Here’s the reasons. And by the way, this is what you’re going to hear in closing is why that’s not logically true. </p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yeah, I mean, I get it why they did it, right. Because, you know --</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Of course, they’re defense.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: -- they’re working with the facts and they wanted to go back that you guys have had this relationship, you and Trump, since 1998 or something like that, right. And this is just the same thing. And, you know, we’ll see the government come back and rebut that. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: I wasn’t trying in any way to say that this is the defense’s job. My point is that our job is to think critically about those arguments. And just to be fair to them, they then pointed out places where like with every witness, David Pecker didn’t remember everything completely clearly. That’s totally fair game. And that’s that you should be crossed on that.</p><p class="">So this is less about the defense lawyer’s job. I think you and I both really respect that when it’s done, you know, within the rules, it’s absolutely necessary to our system. But our job is to think about critically just do those arguments make sense.\xa0</p><p class="">Okay, there’s a motion that was filed with respect to more gag order violations. It’s going to be heard on Wednesday. The court has issued an order requiring Donald Trump to respond and to be present for that because he continues to allegedly violate the gag order.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: And some of these new claims that the D.A. is making involve things that Mr. Trump has said, like right there in the courthouse, in the hallway, during the trial or right after the trial, you know, during a trial day. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Now, Mary, Arizona. So just remind people, everyone should know, like you’re very steeped in the fake electors because of your civil work for ICAP.\xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Right. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: So what did you make of all that? </p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yeah. So, you know, we spent an episode back, I guess, you know, right at the end of February, beginning of March, talking about the fact that we had resolved our case in Wisconsin, brought against the fraudulent electors there and two Trump attorneys, James Troupis and Kenneth Chesebro. That was a civil case. So nobody’s going to jail. \xa0</p><p class="">And in doing so, we got commitments for them not to participate in a scheme like this again, but also and more importantly, troves and troves of e-mails and text messages that really show the genesis of the scheme.</p><p class="">So when I saw this indictment come out on Wednesday, boy, did it read very familiarly to the story we’d been able to tell through all of the documents that we had obtained, as well as, of course, documents that the House Select Committee had obtained and other information that’s come out about the scheme. \xa0</p><p class="">So what we’re seeing now here is criminal charges for different types of fraudulent conducts, conspiracy, fraudulent schemes and artifices, fraudulent schemes and practices and forgery against not only all of the Arizona fake electors, but also another one, two, three, four, five, six, seven as yet not officially named defendants. Now, there’s been speculation by “The Washington Post” and others about who those defendants are.</p><p class="">And I could tell when I quickly skimmed the indictment who some of those other defendants are. But I think what’s important here is they’re going beyond the fake electors into some of the puppet masters, those who were pulling the strings, those who were involved in creating the scheme. That would include people in the campaign, people associated with Donald Trump, people like Boris Epshteyn, people like Mike Roman. And so this is, again, about accountability. \xa0</p><p class="">Now, what’s missing here? We do not have Donald Trump on the other side of the V. He is not a defendant. He is unindicted co-conspirator number one. And, you know, another person who is involved in this indictment and is called co-conspirator number four is Kenneth Chesebro. It’s quite obvious from the allegations that’s who it is. He, of course, was one of our defendants. He, of course, was the source of many, many of the documents that we made public, as well as documents that had already been public. </p><p class="">He is the one who originally came up with the idea for the scheme, wrote the legal memos supporting the scheme. This cause was later taken up by John Eastman, of course, who was very close to the president and, you know, really ran with it. But he’s the one who came up with the idea. James Troupis, the Wisconsin Trump campaign attorney, is the one who introduced Chesebro to Trump campaign officials who were like, this is a great idea. </p><p class="">And I saw throughout the indictment references to James Troupis as well, not by name, but by the fact that this Wisconsin Trump attorney, you know, made these connections with the campaign, then asked, can you guys do this for all of the swing states? That was Boris Epshteyn who asked that. And Chesebro said, yes, we can. Now, what do I take from Chesebro being an unindicted conspirator number four? </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. So that was going to be my question, too.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yeah.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. I actually had two questions for you. One is obviously speculation, but why do you think Chesebro was not charged? And the second, obviously, is why do you think Donald Trump was not charged?</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yeah. Chesebro, you know, it’s been widely reported that he met with the Arizona attorney general as well as other attorneys general and supplied them information and documents. Many of the documents and emails and texts that are referenced here are things that we also obtained from Kenneth Chesebro. So my strong suspicion is that in return for his cooperation, he is not being charged. Donald Trump, that’s a different question.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Can I just ask you on Chesebro? </p><p class="">\xa0Mary McCord: Yeah.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Do you think he’s fully, fully cooperating? Or do you think he cooperated enough so that they didn’t charge him? </p><p class="">Mary McCord: So, my suspicion is that he came and met with them, maybe went in the grand jury, maybe not. I’m not entirely sure. Provided lots of texts and e-mails. And my guess is the cooperation would also include testimony at a trial because certainly if I were the A.G., I would want that, right. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Well, if you were there, I definitely know the answer because you’re going to be like, you know what? You’re either fish or you’re fowl. </p><p class="">Mary McCord: That’s right. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: You know, you’re either a conspirator or you’re a cooperator.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yeah.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: There’s no --</p><p class="">Mary McCord: No halfway. No one leg in, one leg out. Yeah.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Right, exactly. Right. You know, one legged stools here.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yeah, right. But, you know, all of this is us. We don’t know this, you know, officially. We’re just speculating. And then as to Mr. Trump, you know, I’m speculating on that as well. I mean, certainly they painted a broad conspiracy here that I mean, he’s called an unindicted co-conspirator.\xa0</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Right. And it’s all for him. I mean, it’s not --</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Yeah, and it’s all for him. And he certainly had knowledge, not necessarily of every single step of the way, but he had knowledge of what was happening, embraced it. He pushed it. He was advised of it at White House meetings, which are in here, et cetera. That’s also things we revealed through our case.</p><p class="">So I don’t know if they just didn’t want to get bogged down, frankly, with yet another case against Mr. Trump in this year, where there are four criminal cases against Mr. Trump, and they want to be able to get some accountability, move this case along. It could be also they’re thinking of that down the road. But I think some of it could just be for political reasons. And that’s like little p, political and resource reasons. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Can I give you a question, it’s on pages 44 and 45 of the charges, which is there’s sort of a reference to internal White House lawyers saying, I’m just sort of paraphrasing, but we don’t really know what the lawyers, Rudy and Eastman, who are conspirators, according to the Arizona A.G., what they’re telling Donald Trump. \xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Right.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: In other words, whether there’s an issue about whether he knows they’re fake electors versus contingent collectors.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Contingent. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Now, they may have very good reason to think that he knew that these were fake and not contingent. That’s sort of the line between legal and illegal, contingent being that is okay, fake being not okay. And I wonder if they just thought we’re not yet at the point of having proof beyond a reasonable doubt. \xa0</p><p class="">Mary McCord: That could be. I think there is other evidence, you know, including the meeting at the White House. I mean, certainly their evidence is not as strong on this, at least according to indictment with respect to Mr. Trump as it is with some of the others, so. </p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: So, Mary, this has been fascinating. It was an interesting day yesterday. So to be continued, obviously, there’s the trial that’s continuing today. We will have another gag order hearing --</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Next week.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: -- next week. I have actually some thoughts about alternatives that we can talk about next week as to what the judge might do in addition to just finding that could be useful. </p><p class="">Mary McCord: Right.</p><p class="">Andrew Weissmann: Once again, Professor Ryan Goodman came up with a good idea. I know our friend, mutual friend Neal Katyal also had an idea. So we can talk about those as we talk about the gag order. It’ll be fascinating to see the continuation of the trial. And, you know, Mary, as hard as it is to do all of the TV work and now we’re doing not one but two podcasts a week, it really I have to say the sanity of this is getting to spend time talking with you and having my blood pressure go down and listening to sober, clear analysis that’s dispassionate, so thank you.</p><p class="">Mary McCord: Well, I appreciate that. If this is where our blood pressure goes down, I can’t even imagine where it started, but okay. I’ll take it. And I just want to also say we really do intend to get to listener questions. We just had so much today. We didn’t do it.

But if they keep the <a href="https://popular.info/p/why-millions-of-americans-may-lose" target="_blank">popular and effective</a> Affordable Connectivity Program going, the beneficiaries might be pleased, and might even give Biden credit for the good news.</p><p class="">And so, the future of the ACP appears bleak, at least for now.</p><p class="">Unfortunately, it’s not the only priority running into this problem. Congressional Republicans also cut funding for the 21st Century Cures Act — part of the Democratic president’s cancer moonshot. Explaining why, a Politico <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/29/congress-is-killing-bidens-cancer-moonshot-00154718" target="_blank">report</a> added this week, “The new budget is tight across the board, reflecting Republicans’ control of the House, deficit concerns and, not least, their desire to deny Biden a win months before the election.”</p><p class="">And what about the bipartisan tax deal, which extended Trump-era tax breaks for businesses and expanded the child tax credit?

The state asked the judge to fine Trump and instruct him to take down offending posts. Notably, the prosecutor in court last week said Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\'s office wasn\'t yet asking for incarceration and argued that Trump seemed to be angling for that.</p><p class="">The fines are due by close of business on Friday. The judge also ordered Trump to remove the seven offending posts from his Truth Social account and the two offending posts from his campaign website by 2:15 p.m. Tuesday.</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">Merchan noted that he was limited by the $1,000 maximum for each violation</p></div><p class="">Merchan noted that he was limited by the $1,000 maximum for each violation, which may not do much to deter a wealthy defendant. Given the lack of discretion to impose a more serious fine for Trump, the judge wrote that he “must therefore consider whether in some instances, jail may be a necessary punishment.” He explicitly warned the defendant in his ruling Tuesday that he won’t tolerate continued willful violations and that he will jail him if necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.</p><p class="">Prosecutors raised the former president’s posts on social media and his campaign website as violating Merchan’s order. In one of the posts in question, Trump purportedly quoted Fox News host Jesse Watters as saying, “They are catching undercover Liberal Activists lying to the Judge in order to get on the Trump Jury.” </p><p class="">The presumptive GOP presidential nominee’s post wasn’t a repost but apparently typed out and distributed to his followers. Notably, Trump didn’t simply quote Watters but added his own language. That post "constitutes a clear violation" of the gag order, Merchan wrote. </p><p class="">When it comes to <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-trial-gag-order-jurors-rcna148373" target="_blank">juror-related statements</a>, Merchan’s\xa0<a href="https://www.nycourts.gov/LegacyPDFS/press/PDFs/Clarification-OrderRestrictingES.pdf" target="_blank">order</a>\xa0bars Trump from “making or directing others to make public statements about any prospective juror or any juror in this criminal proceeding.” As for witnesses, the order bars Trump from making statements about their “potential participation in the investigation or in this criminal proceeding.” The prosecution also raised the prospect of further violations for comments Trump made against Michael Cohen, who’s <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/michael-cohen-will-be-at-witness-at-hush-money-trial-advisor-confirms-208847941770" target="_blank">set to be a key state witness at trial</a>. Merchan\'s ruling comes as yet another gag order hearing is set for Thursday on further alleged violations.<strong>  </strong></p><p class="">Trump lawyer Todd Blanche argued that the defendant didn’t violate Merchan’s order and complained that it’s Trump who is facing attacks from witnesses, citing Cohen and Stormy Daniels, another potentially crucial state witness. Blanche also said some posts didn\'t violate the gag order because they were reposts. Merchan, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/live-blog/trump-hush-money-live-updates-day-6-rcna148919" target="_blank">reportedly frustrated</a> with Blanche during the hearing, observed that Blanche\'s repost argument doesn\'t apply to the Watters post.

The ill-fated wirehaired pointer, a puppy named Cricket, was difficult to control, it wasn’t taking well to being trained as a hunting dog, and it even killed some chickens belonging to a neighbor. “I hated that dog,” Noem writes, and she concluded he had to be put down.

Her opponents certainly reacted, with a bit of outrage and a lot of <a href="https://twitter.com/GovTimWalz/status/1784008322787516671" target="_blank">mockery</a>.

Every story in these books serves a purpose, and the purpose of the Cricket story isn’t hard to discern. It paints Noem as tough and decisive, doing what must be done. It also highlights the fact that she’s a gun owner hailing from a rural state, at a time when Donald Trump, a son of Queens, might just be looking for a running mate with rural cred to round out his ticket.</p><p class="">As Noem explained in <a href="https://twitter.com/kristinoem/status/1784631108207849781" target="_blank">a follow-up tweet</a>, “people are looking for leaders who are authentic, willing to learn from the past, and don’t shy away from tough challenges,” adding: “Whether running the ranch or in politics, I have never passed on my responsibilities to anyone else to handle. Even if it’s hard and painful.”</p><p class="">Like many a politician from her part of the country, Noem has always sold herself as a gun-totin’ woman of the plains. Just two years ago, she published a book titled “Not My First Rodeo: Lessons From the Heartland.” As the rural-urban political divide <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00027162211070061" target="_blank">has grown</a> — Republicans have painted themselves as strong and connected to the land, while their opponents are supposedly effete urbanites who couldn’t drive a tractor or put down a dog if their lives depended on it.\xa0</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">Had Noem wanted to tread a more well-worn path, she might have simply attacked cities, as more than a few Republicans have done. </p></div><p class="">What that has to do with the actual work of politics is seldom explained, but Republicans everywhere are eager to tout their rural connections. David McCormick, the GOP nominee for the Senate in Pennsylvania, has long said he “started with nothing” and “grew up on a family farm,” but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/19/us/politics/dave-mccormick-farm-pennsylvania.html" target="_blank">it turns out</a> his father was a college president, and while the family did own a farm, it was more of a country estate where his mother raised Arabian horses. Another Republican Senate nominee, Tim Sheehy, has told Montana voters, “I grew up in rural Minnesota,” <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/gop-star-recruit-tim-sheehy-brags-about-rural-upbringing-that-wasnt" target="_blank">by which he means</a> he grew up in a multimillion-dollar lake house in a suburb of St. Paul.\xa0</p><p class="">Unlike theirs, Noem’s rural roots are legitimate; she really did grow up on her family’s ranch and farm, and her father <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/argus-leader-ronald-arnold-father-of-sd/62073232/" target="_blank">died</a> after he was smothered in a grain bin. Had Noem wanted to tread a more well-worn path, she might have simply attacked cities, as more than a few Republicans have done. She could have gone to San Francisco for a day and claimed, <a href="https://twitter.com/RonDeSantis/status/1671300453521408001" target="_blank">as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis did</a> after his brief foray there, to have seen public defecation and heroin and crack use. That would have fit in nicely with the regular messages on conservative media that cities are hellholes of crime and depravity. Or like Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-joni-ernsts-ad-about-castrating-hogs-transformed-iowas-us-senate-race/2014/05/11/c02d1804-d85b-11e3-95d3-3bcd77cd4e11_story.html" target="_blank">did 10 years ago</a>, Noem could have talked proudly about castrating hogs, a farm animal most Americans are far less emotional about.</p><p class="">Fashioning political identities out of the stories of candidates’ personal lives is a subtle art; they want to seem connected to regular folks, even if they’re supposed to be just a bit better than us. Which is why they show us their mundane sides: Here I am shooting hoops with my kids or cooking dinner or filling up my car. But if candidates show us something unusual about themselves, it had better not be at the expense of creatures for which so many of us have such deep feelings of affection and protectiveness. When <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/07/07/about-half-us-of-pet-owners-say-their-pets-are-as-much-a-part-of-their-family-as-a-human-member/" target="_blank">over half of dog owners</a> say their pets are as much a part of their families as the humans, one should tread carefully. Even the least sentimental readers might wonder why Noem didn’t just give Cricket to someone better able to train him.\xa0</p><p class="endmark">The lesson seems clear: If you’re going to troll, don’t mess with the animals who are a beloved part of tens of millions of American families.

His subjugation deepened Sunday with the news that <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-meets-privately-former-gop-rival-ron-desantis-rcna149715" target="_blank">DeSantis and Trump broke bread in a private breakfast</a>.</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">In his tightening embrace of Trump, DeSantis isn’t clinging to any sort of principle, just a need to be in proximity to power.</p></div><p class="">In the past, this sort of willingness to let bygones be bygones among former rivals could be seen as a point in favor of democracy. After all, being able to put aside differences and work together for common goals is a welcome change of pace to the sort of lingering political strife and turmoil that once led countries to civil war. But in his tightening embrace of Trump, DeSantis isn’t clinging to any sort of principle, just a need to be in proximity to power.</p><p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"></p><p class="">The morning meeting at a Florida golf club, which was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/28/trump-desantis-meeting/" target="_blank">first reported by The Washington Post</a>, was the first time the two men had spoken since DeSantis’ withdrawal after his third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses. There was no love lost between them during the race, with DeSantis only slowly realizing that he <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/ron-desantis-amps-attacks-trump-rcna111417" target="_blank">needed to hammer at Trump</a> in the face of a <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trumps-attack-ron-desantis-flat-tax-hits-home-rcna85337" target="_blank">tirade of mockery and attacks from the former president</a>. The wounds were still fresh in February when DeSantis voiced a laundry list of concerns he still had with Trump <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/ron-desantis-concerns-trump-private-call-supporters-rcna139859" target="_blank">during a call with supporters</a>. That included skepticism about how Trump will choose a potential running mate, which prompted a fiery rebuttal from the front-runner’s campaign. “Ron DeSantis failed miserably in his presidential campaign and does not have a voice in selecting the next vice president of the United States,” a spokesperson said in response.</p><p class="">It’s incredible how much things can change in just a few short weeks. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/ron-desantis-privately-donors-plans-fundraise-trump-rcna147160" target="_blank">NBC News reported</a> that DeSantis had told supporters and donors that he was willing to help fundraise for Trump. When DeSantis’ name was first being talked about as a presidential candidate, he was promoting himself as the rightful heir to Trumpism, and he managed to pull together a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/01/desantis-donors-finance-campaign-00109142" target="_blank">pool of wealthy donors</a> to bankroll his efforts. While <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/16/desantis-super-pac-collapse/" target="_blank">the cash flow dried up</a> as it became clear that he was being steamrolled by Trump, it’s likely that many of DeSantis’ major supporters will follow his lead and support the party’s nominee with their checkbooks.</p><p class="">The olive branch comes at an opportune time for Trump, given his campaign’s struggle to outraise President Joe Biden and the <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-new-york-criminal-case-legal-fees-rcna146993" target="_blank">massive outflow of cash</a> going toward his legal defense. The meeting came after weeks of negotiations between the camps courtesy of Steve Witkoff, a Florida real estate company owner with ties to both Republicans. In a sign, though, of how little Trump wants it to look like he needs DeSantis, a campaign official <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-meets-privately-former-gop-rival-ron-desantis-rcna149715" target="_blank">told NBC News\xa0</a>that DeSantis reached out\xa0<em>through</em>\xa0Witkoff two weeks ago, seeking to set up a meeting to discuss fundraising and “bury the hatchet.”</p><p class="">As with so many things surrounding Trump, even the supposedly normal acts take on a dangerous sheen. Yes, of course, runner-up candidates will strive to help unite the party and bring their supporters back into the fold in the hopes of winning the general election. There is also a less than altruistic motive to these reconciliations. The defeated candidate <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/bernie-sanders-scores-big-wins-democratic-platform-msna872766" target="_blank">typically hopes to have some impact</a> on the direction of the party à la Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in 2016. With Trump, though, not only is there little chance DeSantis will influence his course of action, but his backing also shows either naivete of the threat Trump poses to democratic governance in this country or agreement with Trump’s plan.</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">For DeSantis, his attempts to play nice are more unprincipled than an outright embrace of autocracy would be.</p></div><p class="">For DeSantis, his attempts to play nice are more unprincipled than an outright embrace of autocracy would be. Instead, he is most likely angling himself to be Trump’s successor (for real this time) during a renewed run for the presidency in 2028. After all, he’s term-limited as governor and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/03/09/desantis-florida-woke-culture-wars-legislature/" target="_blank">spent a lot of his political capital</a> in his failed presidential bid. But Trump has previously been reported as wanting to punish DeSantis beyond the primary for his supposed betrayal in running against him.</p><p class="">It’s true that Trump doesn’t forgive easily —\xa0but he <em>does</em> love when people show remorse for what he views as disloyalty. Especially when that groveling comes with dollar signs attached to it. DeSantis is likely hoping that his donors opening up their wallets to Trump now will smooth the tension between their camps and open up a lane for him to finally claim the GOP nomination in four years.</p><p class="endmark">It’s a bet that hinges on Trump not actually following through on his “joke” that he <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/serving-more-two-terms-trump-s-tone-turns-serious-n1237280" target="_blank">deserves a third term</a> because of the (self-inflicted) turmoil of his first should he win in November. Given the willingness of the GOP to ignore, if not outright reward, his past attempts to overturn an election, tolerating Trump ignoring the 22nd Amendment over a second DeSantis run doesn’t seem that outlandish. It also depends on Trump letting go of a grievance and not making DeSantis a permanent punching bag. I’m not sure which one is the worse wager right now, but either way DeSantis is again proving himself to be a poor gambler.</p></div></div></body></html>', "Ron DeSantis' cowardly surrender to Trump is now complete"}

Despite perceived progress, traditional gendered roles within households remain a pervasive expectation, leading to women conceiving, planning, and executing most domestic tasks. In marriages across the U.S. where the wife is the primary breadwinner, she earns more than 60 percent\xa0of the couple’s combined earnings, yet has 3.5 fewer leisure hours than her partner. This constant burden means that time, even to grieve, can feel out of reach for us.\xa0</p><h3 class=""><strong>How to build bereavement into workplace culture</strong></h3><p class="">The ability to take bereavement leave requires a multi-pronged approach. Firstly, more time off is the most obvious step. Five days off is perfunctory, not generous. Next, redefine who is included in one’s “immediate family,” to also include “immediate loved ones.” That is paramount because our grief extends to our chosen family, and their loss is no less felt.</p><p class="">For women in the workplace, paid bereavement leave is the most supportive approach, especially as we continue to grow as sole or primary breadwinners for our families. And finally, we must create space to actually allow people to move through the process of grief by offering increased mental health benefits and prioritizing mental health awareness. Grief is an incredibly vulnerable time that comes in waves, and expanded employee assistance offerings can positively impact engagement and productivity.</p><p class="">The issue of bereavement leave transcends workplace or federal policy; it strikes at the heart of societal values and workplace culture. My experiences, while deeply personal, reflect a broader trend that demands attention and action. It is time for a cultural shift where the need for grieving is acknowledged and supported, regardless of gender or familial relationship. Employers must recognize that productivity should not come at the cost of employees’ well-being, but that the quality of their employees’ well-being, in fact, drives productivity. It’s about time we redefine what it means to support our colleagues during their most vulnerable moments.\xa0</p><p class="">Legislation and workplace policies are essential, though true change requires a collective effort to challenge ingrained norms and biases. We need to work toward a future where taking time to grieve is not a luxury but a fundamental right, a necessary part of the human experience.</p><p class="endmark">No one should grieve alone or feel the need to “grin and bear it” for productivity’s sake, prioritizing unrealistic workplace expectations over personal well-being. Our willingness to expand bereavement leave speaks to our values as organizations and who we aspire to be as a society.\xa0</p></div></div></body></html>', 'https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/out-of-office/many-women-think-taking-bereavement-leave-will-hurt-careers-wont-rcna149864', 'Many women think taking bereavement leave will hurt their careers - it won’t.'}

So now that his Supreme Court immunity appeal <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/donald-trump-immunity-supreme-court-rcna149390" target="_blank">has been argued</a>, a big question is: When is the opinion, which is standing in the way of a trial, coming?</p><p class="">The court doesn’t announce ahead of time when specific opinions will be issued.

Trump v. United States was the final hearing, meaning the justices are now focused on writing the remaining opinions in <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/terms/ot2023/" target="_blank">cases argued since October</a>. In thinking about the timing of the immunity decision, then, consider that there is much, much more to be decided besides that important case. Among others, the justices are crafting pivotal rulings on <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-guns-ketanji-brown-jackson-rcna124027" target="_blank">guns</a>, <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-emergency-abortions-idaho-alito-rcna149218" target="_blank">abortion</a>, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-delay-prompts-federal-judges-act-south-carolina-redistri-rcna145267" target="_blank">gerrymandering</a> and appeals <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-chevron-precedent-kagan-rcna134342" target="_blank">striking at the core of how government functions</a>.</p><p class="">So it’s a monumental term even if you don’t consider Trump, notwithstanding the Supreme Court as a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/06/26/a-quarter-of-republicans-voted-for-trump-to-get-supreme-court-picks-and-it-paid-off/" target="_blank">motivating factor</a> for his 2016 election and his resultant three appointments — <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/neil-gorsuch-303-creative-supreme-court-rcna91471" target="_blank">Neil Gorsuch</a>, <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/kavanaugh-supreme-court-alabama-map-roberts-rcna104355" target="_blank">Brett Kavanaugh</a> and <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/amy-coney-barrett-opinion-trump-ballot-ruling-misplaced-worry-rcna141679" target="_blank">Amy Coney Barrett</a>. Indeed, another of the court’s important cases this term that doesn’t directly involve Trump also will affect him — namely <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-jan-6-trump-joseph-fischer-rcna147937" target="_blank">Fischer v. United States</a>, the appeal from an alleged Jan. 6 rioter that <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/full-text-trump-indictment-pdf-jack-smith-jan-6-2020-election-rcna96030" target="_blank">challenges one of the statutes</a> Trump is charged with in his Jan. 6-related case. The presumptive GOP presidential nominee has pleaded not guilty in all four of his criminal cases, one of which is <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-hush-money-trial-witness-testimony-takeaways-rcna149542" target="_blank">on trial in New York</a>.</p><p class="">Typically, the Supreme Court wraps up its decisions by the end of June, which is why some of the <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2015/06/25/live-updates-supreme-court-upholds-key-part-affordable-care-act" target="_blank">most contentious and historic ones</a> come then. That isn’t an official deadline, because the current term technically runs through the beginning of the next one in October. But late June is a fair deadline to keep in mind and is likely what the justices are aiming for with all their rulings.</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">Given the other pivotal cases on deck, it may be more of a question of how the justices prioritize the Trump immunity ruling against their other work.</p></div><p class="">Given the other pivotal cases on deck, it may be more of a question of how the justices prioritize the Trump immunity ruling against their other work. Viewed that way, the prospect of a quick ruling is a mixed bag, at best. On the one hand, the justices could have punted consideration of the case into next term <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-supreme-court-immunity-review-rcna139183" target="_blank">when they took it up in February</a>. But their scheduling of the argument was only so expedited, because they put the case on for <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-trump-immunity-date-last-case-rcna142211" target="_blank">literally the last hearing day</a> of the term. Plus, the hearing itself <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-hears-trump-immunity-claim-election-interference-case-rcna149182" target="_blank">displayed differences of opinion</a> among the justices over how to sort out the case, suggesting that it won’t be easy to do so quickly, even if that’s what the court as a whole wanted to do.</p><p class="">All of this points toward a ruling in Trump’s immunity case coming around that crush of crucial decisions in late June. Depending on what that ruling says exactly, it may be too late for the Jan. 6-related case to get to trial before the election (if Trump wins that election, he could kill the case in which he is alleged to have unlawfully tried to overturn the last presidential election).</p><p class="">The court could always surprise us with a sooner decision than that.

And after it was over, I realized another unpleasant job needed to be done,” Noem wrote. She then went on to kill a family goat, which she called “nasty and mean.” Noem also led the goat to a gravel pit, where she said her first shot wounded but did not kill the animal. She got another shell for her gun and killed the goat, according to the book.</p><p></p><small class="blockquote__source"><span></span></small></blockquote></section><p class="">Noem’s book, according to her publisher, will “packed with surprising stories.” My MSNBC colleague Clarissa-Jan Lim <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kristi-noem-dog-goat-book-trump-rcna149609" target="_blank">added</a> over the weekend, “The publisher isn’t wrong.”</p><p class="">To put it mildly, Noem’s anecdote has not been well received.

Rather than express sadness or regret about the situation, Noem goes on to write that she ‘hated that dog.’” </p><p class="">As the news circulated, the GOP governor made no effort to deny her own story. On Friday morning, for example, Noem responded to the original reporting in the Guardian by <a href="https://twitter.com/KristiNoem/status/1783849977409671483" target="_blank">writing</a> on social media, “We love animals, but tough decisions like this happen all the time on a farm.”</p><p class="">When that failed to have much of an impact, the South Dakotan issued <a href="https://twitter.com/KristiNoem/status/1784631108207849781" target="_blank">a second statement</a>, in which she said, among other things, “The fact is, South Dakota law states that dogs who attack and kill livestock can be put down. Given that Cricket had shown aggressive behavior toward people by biting them, I decided what I did. Whether running the ranch or in politics, I have never passed on my responsibilities to anyone else to handle. Even if it’s hard and painful. I followed the law and was being a responsible parent, dog owner, and neighbor.”</p><p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"></p><p class="">All of this came against a backdrop in which Noem has spent months positioning herself as a possible running mate for Donald Trump, though her odds were already fading before Friday.

Anything’s possible, but even Trump would prefer to avoid questions such as, “Why did your running mate shoot an overly enthusiastic puppy?”</p><p class="">What’s more, plenty of other Republicans are still traumatized over Mitt Romney and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mitt-romneys-dog-on-the-car-roof-story-still-proves-to-be-his-critics-best-friend/2012/03/14/gIQAp2LxCS_story.html" target="_blank">dog-on-the-car-roof story</a>, and this one’s vastly worse.</p><p class="">All of which leaves us with a question that has no obvious answer: <em>Why in the world would Noem admit to something like this?</em> I won’t pretend to know what the governor was thinking, but there are plenty of possibilities:</p><p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"></p><p class=""><strong>Maybe she doesn’t want to be Trump’s running mate</strong>.

As Election Day 2016 approached, Trump and his political operation were concerned about the public learning about his alleged extramarital sexual encounter with a porn star who goes by the name Stormy Daniels.

The rule also applies to future power plants that use natural gas instead of coal, forcing them to capture any carbon emissions they create. Three other rules further limit the amount of mercury coal-fired plants can produce, restrict total wastewater pollutants and mandate the safe disposal of coal ash.</p><p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"></p><p class=""><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/25/climate/biden-power-plants-pollution.html" target="_blank">The New York Times framed</a> the regulations as a possible “death blow in the United States to coal” — something that would be a net positive for the planet but will receive tremendous pushback from conservatives. And there are plenty of other targets for that pushback. In the last few weeks, the administration has also finalized rules <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/28/climate/endangered-species-rules-regulations.html" target="_blank">protecting endangered species</a> threatened by climate change, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/19/us/politics/biden-title-ix-rules.html" target="_blank">extended legal protections to LGBTQ students</a> under Title IX and <a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20240423-0" target="_blank">expanded eligibility for overtime pay</a>.</p><p class="">Each of these changes faces a twofold threat. First, all of the regulations, which take years to craft and get through the public comment period, are subject to the Congressional Review Act. Congress has <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/state-federal/congressional-review-act-overview-and-tracking" target="_blank">tried to use the CRA several times</a> since Republicans reclaimed the House last year to reverse Biden administration policies. But <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/state-federal/congressional-review-act-overview-and-tracking" target="_blank">those resolutions of disapproval</a>, which require simple majorities in both the House and the Senate to pass, are subject to presidential vetoes, which means President Joe Biden can prevent them from taking effect.</p><p class="">Only a relatively small number of resolutions have managed to get past the Democratic-controlled Senate. It’s unclear which party will control either chamber next year, though, with the House narrowly divided and Democrats needing to defend more Senate seats this cycle. If the GOP is in the majority on both sides of the Capitol next year, the number of challenges to Biden-era rules is sure to increase.</p><p class="">The other risk comes from former President Donald Trump. Should he return to the White House next year, he’ll undoubtedly begin the process of reversing these rules, having <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-second-term-biden-climate-change-rcna126810" target="_blank">already pledged to do so</a>. It can be just as slow and unwieldy a process to undo a rule as it is to pass one in the first place —\xa0but not if a Republican Congress makes it easy for him by sending resolutions of disapproval to his desk.</p><p class="">Congress for the most part can use the CRA to look only at rules that were finalized during the current session. However, the law includes a “look-back” window that permits lawmakers to review rules passed within the final 60 legislative days of the previous session. Beating that deadline and preventing a potential GOP-dominated Congress from quickly reversing all the current administration’s work is the name of the game for Team Biden right now.</p><p class="">But there’s a further complication: <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/murky-deadline-looms-for-bidens-regs/" target="_blank">Nobody knows</a> exactly when that clock runs out. The House and the Senate maintain their own legislative calendars, which are unmoored from the constraints of linear time. A <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R42977" target="_blank">“legislative day”</a> typically begins when the chamber convenes after an adjournment and ends when it adjourns again, so a “legislative day” can last several calendar days, or several could be packed into one calendar day. The number of legislative days on the calendar is also subject to change, as recesses could be cut short and must-pass legislation could need to be passed in a lame duck session. The current estimates for when the look-back window opens range from May 22 to late June, according to <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/murky-deadline-looms-for-bidens-regs/" target="_blank">a survey of experts undertaken by E&amp;E News</a>.</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">Even more costly, though, is the economic effect of not acting to mitigate climate change. </p></div><p class="">On one hand, this scramble is symptomatic of congressional Republicans’ (and a few Democrats’) refusal to support major climate legislation, forcing Democratic presidents to overly rely on executive orders and rulemaking. As a result, we’ve seen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/26/climate/biden-trump-environmental-regulations.html" target="_blank">wild swings back and forth</a> on climate policy between President Barack Obama’s and Biden’s time in office. Trump spent his administration undoing as much of the former’s efforts to fight climate change as possible and, if he wins in the fall, is poised to do so again with the latter’s.</p><p class="">These shifts are extremely costly for businesses forced to guess how long a new regulation may be in place when determining new investments. That uncertainty, as <a href="https://www.policyuncertainty.com/media/Annotated_CPU.pdf" target="_blank">estimated by one economist</a>, prompts a shock wave across the business landscape with each giant policy swing. Even more costly, though, is the economic effect of not acting to mitigate climate change. A recent study from German researchers estimated that “climate change will sap 19 percent of global income by 2050 compared to a world with no climate change, equivalent to $38 trillion every year — six times as much as the estimated cost to limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius,” <a href="https://www.splinter.com/climate-change-will-erase-38-trillion-every-year-by-2050" target="_blank">Splinter recently reported</a>.\xa0</p><p class="endmark">It’s hard to stress, then, how dystopian it is that these new rules and others like them are so sure to be reversed as soon as possible if Republicans win in November. It’s similarly baffling that the GOP under Trump is so abjectly determined to ensure the worst-case scenario for climate change comes to pass. As wide as the gap is between the two parties on a multitude of issues, no matter how much people can claim they’re the same, only one can accurately be called the greatest threat to humanity’s future.</p></div></div></body></html>'}

But when a prominent Republican declares that he can’t vote for Trump and then completely trashes Biden by calling him “not qualified to be president,” that’s a different story. And I believe it’s one that should be called out.</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">In spite of stating over and over that he doesn’t want to see Trump elected again, Christie risks sacrificing the future of the country over his obsession with his own relevance.</p></div><p class="">Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie recently brought his straightforward, call-it-as-he-sees-it style in full force during a discussion with Leigh Ann Caldwell from The Washington Post at the\xa0<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUZIK4xNl-w" target="_blank">University of Chicago Institute of Politics</a>. It didn’t take long to see that behind his attempt to project a happy warrior image, he is still bitter over his own failed run for the presidency. Worse yet, in spite of stating over and over that he doesn’t want to see Trump elected again, Christie risks sacrificing the future of the country over his obsession with his own relevance.</p><p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"></p><p class="">Christie stated that he would not be voting for Biden, and that Trump is “wholly unfit to be president of the United States, in every way you can think of.”\xa0He could have stopped there; but then he commented that Biden is past his “sell-by date,” and that he didn’t believe Biden is up for another term. He also voiced his dismay over the fact that team Biden hasn’t reach out to him.</p><p class="">Christie knows full well how these sort of comments can be used against Biden, and worse yet, can help Trump should they be used in a very targeted way. Christie himself was <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2012/11/romney-camp-blames-christie-for-election-loss.html#/" target="_blank">blamed by some people</a> (wrongly, I believe) for hurting Mitt Romney’s campaign when he <a href="https://www.nj.com/news/2012/11/sandy_brings_gov_christie_obam.html" target="_blank">welcomed then-President Barack Obama</a> with a warm handshake upon his arrival to New Jersey to see the devastating damage from Superstorm Sandy just days before the 2012 presidential election.</p><p class="">For years I have generally liked Christie, even though I haven’t always agreed with him. I was disappointed with his choice to endorse Trump in 2016 and even more so after he actively helped Trump in his re-election campaign, when the dangers of a second Trump term were obvious. I thought I was done with him then, but when he rightly called out the former president immediately after the 2020 election, his was a welcome voice in the 2024 Republican primary.</p><p class="">Christie had a good run; he talked about the issues and most of all brought the fight directly to Trump. When it turned out Nikki Haley had a better campaign, his decision not to endorse her once he dropped out seemed petty. But it was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/chris-christie-caught-hot-mic-saying-nikki-haley-was-going-get-smoked-rcna133370" target="_blank">his “hot mic” moment in January</a>, saying, “She’s going to get smoked — you and I both know it. She’s not up to this,” that showed us exactly how spiteful he could be. Although <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4450841-christie-haley-getting-smoked-trump-hot-mic-remark-complete-mistake/" target="_blank">he called the gaffe a</a> “complete mistake,” it still shows as pretty weak.</p><p class="">Clearly, Christie now wants everyone to hear what he’s saying about Haley and Biden, and he wasn’t shy about calling both of them out during his\xa0University of Chicago talk. During the conversation with Caldwell, Christie said he didn’t run as an independent because he didn’t see a path to winning, and he wouldn’t be able to live with himself if his run ended up hurting Biden and helping Trump get elected.</p><p class="">Christie may deserve some leeway with his initial Biden comments; after all, he has significant policy differences with Biden, and he wanted to be the Republican nominee to run again Biden this fall. But in the question-and-answer portion of the talk, he really unleashed on Biden, saying he was not qualified to be president. (He also took a parting shot at Haley, saying she will run for president in 2028, and “she will stand for just as little as she stood for this time.”)</p><p class="">After working with politicians for over 30 years, I have seen just how much it pains many of them not to be relevant in the public square. But Christie should know better than to let his own feelings potentially influence an election in such a dangerous way.</p><p class="endmark">It’s OK for Christie not to support Biden, and maybe his feeling are hurt because team Biden hasn’t extended an invitation to him to join in on a run against Trump — all of which comes back to the need to be relevant. What is not OK is for Christie to run off at the mouth, putting his own ego ahead of what is best for the country.</p></div></div></body></html>', 'Why Chris Christie’s spiteful Biden comments are so dangerous', 'https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/chris-christie-biden-trump-comments-rcna149533'}

Morehouse, a 157-year-old historically Black college in Atlanta, extended the invitation to Biden in September, the month before Hamas launched a deadly attack in Israel and took hostages. But news of the president’s scheduled address wasn’t announced until last week, when anti-war protesters on college campuses across the country were <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/live-blog/columbia-protests-live-update-encampment-continue-college-negotiates-p-rcna149111" target="_blank">demonstrating against Israel’s brutal response in Gaza</a>. Morehouse’s announcement that Biden would be giving the school’s commencement address justifiably ignited anger among students, staff and alumni.</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">Morehouse’s announcement that Biden would be giving the school’s commencement address justifiably ignited anger among students, staff and alumni.</p></div><p class="">As reported by Capital B Atlanta, during an <a href="https://atlanta.capitalbnews.org/biden-morehouse-town-hall/" target="_blank">April 23 town hall </a>with Morehouse President David Thomas, students expressed concern about Biden not only being the speaker, but also receiving an honorary degree from the institution. “How are you going to justify what you’re going to bestow on [Biden] on our behalf when he’s basically a war criminal at this point?” one student asked in reference to the honorary degree.</p><p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"></p><p class="">“I want to know if you’ve been paid to provide Biden a platform to address the student body,” another student asked, a claim Thomas forcefully denied. “I have not been paid. I have not been bought,” Thomas responded. “That question is an insult, but because you are a student here, I owe you the opportunity to do it. But I’m going to call it out.”</p><p class="">This country’s historically Black colleges and universities have long been <a href="https://www.insightintodiversity.com/african-american-history-a-look-back-at-early-student-activism/" target="_blank">bastions of protest</a>. For decades, HBCU students have risked everything from expulsion to incarceration to fight for social justice and to stand for the oppressed. Many Black Americans, these Morehouse students included, see a clear connection between Black people’s plight in the United States and the plight of the Palestinian people in Gaza. That makes Thomas’ vow not to replace Biden as the commencement speaker even more upsetting.</p><p class="">“I’ve spoken with several faculty members who say under no conditions are they going to sit on a stage with Joe Biden,” Andrew Douglas, a political science professor at Morehouse, told <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/morehouse-faculty-students-concerns-biden-graduation-speech-rcna149283" target="_blank">NBC News</a>. “It’s on everybody’s mind,” he said. Douglas, who’s been at Morehouse for 13 years, joined 14 other members of the faculty council in writing a letter to Thomas expressing their disappointment at the school’s choice to bring Biden to campus at such a fraught moment.</p><p class="">In a separate letter to Thomas, obtained by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-morehouse-hbcus-2024-election-black-voters-821d03639c2d9ad7d311b3f63541e3ed" target="_blank">The Associated Press</a>, some Morehouse alumni refer to Martin Luther King Jr., a Nobel Peace Prize-winning alumnus of Morehouse. “In inviting President Biden to campus,” those alumni wrote, “the college affirms a cruel standard that complicity in genocide merits no sanction from the institution that produced one of the towering advocates for nonviolence of the twentieth century.” King, who embraced nonviolence as a political strategy, won the award in 1964 for his civil rights advocacy, but he said winning the peace prize was “a commission” that compelled him to <a href="https://guides.lib.berkeley.edu/c.php?g=819842&amp;p=5924547" target="_blank">oppose the Vietnam War</a> in particular <a href="https://thekingcenter.org/about-tkc/the-king-philosophy/#:~:text=The%20Triple%20Evils%20of%20POVERTY,evil%2C%20we%20affect%20all%20evils." target="_blank">and “militarism” generally</a>.</p><p class="">“If the college cannot affirm this noble tradition of justice by rescinding its invitation to President Biden, then the college should reconsider its attachment to Dr. King,” those alumni wrote.</p><p class="">Some current students agree, with one telling <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/25/morehouse-students-biden-commencement-speaker" target="_blank">The Guardian</a> it’s “absolutely unacceptable” for an HBCU that “prides itself on social justice” to invite a president whose administration supports, to an extent, the war in Gaza, to their campus. However, Provost Kendrick Brown told <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/morehouse-faculty-students-concerns-biden-graduation-speech-rcna149283" target="_blank">NBC News</a> that having Biden speak “is something that is in line with Morehouse’s mission and also with this objective of being a place that allows for engagement of social justice issues and moral concerns.”</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">Morehouse’s attempt to connect this invitation to the college’s storied history of encouraging protest is both bewildering and disingenuous.</p></div><p class="">He added, “We certainly encourage our students, our faculty, our staff, to form strong opinions and to come together peacefully and engage in that. So the way I see this is, this is certainly an opportunity … for our community to engage with the president to express the range of views that exist on the present issues, certainly in Israel and Gaza.”</p><p class="">One hopes Biden will be open to hearing concerns about Gaza from Black students, a constituency essential to his re-election campaign. But Morehouse’s attempt to connect this invitation to the college’s storied history of encouraging protest is both bewildering and disingenuous. Holding on to the choice of Biden as speaker also defies the will of some students — many of whom attend college to better understand their place in the world — and some faculty, who are tasked with guiding those students toward that understanding and toward their purpose.</p><p class="">In the 1960s, students at multiple HBCUs, including <a href="https://www.atlantaga.gov/visitors/history/atlanta-student-movement" target="_blank">Morehouse</a>, were integral to the fight to desegregate public and private facilities and increase access to the ballot box. The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, a historic collective of activists, was formed at a conference at Shaw University, while students from Bennett College (my HBCU) and North Carolina A&amp;T were the architects of a sit-in movement that spread to colleges across the country.</p><p class="">That spirit of protest hasn’t died; in fact, as multiple social issues have presented themselves, HBCU students have risen to the occasion. As <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/12/opinions/spelman-morehouse-dealing-with-sexual-misconduct-campbell-thomas-opinion/index.html" target="_blank">the #MeToo movement</a>\xa0gained prominence, students at Spelman College, which shares the Atlanta University Center campus with Clark Atlanta University and Morehouse, protested the school’s treatment of sexual assault survivors, leading to the formation of an anti-assault task force. After a Ferguson, Missouri, police officer fatally shot Michael Brown in 2014, <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/how-a-st-louis-hbcu-deeply-touched-by-ferguson-handled-a-difficult-year/" target="_blank">HBCU students</a> across the country, <a href="https://www.jacksonville.com/story/news/2014/11/26/protesters-atlanta-oppose-ferguson-decision-marching-morehouse/15643754007/" target="_blank">Atlanta</a> students included, protested the killing and a grand jury’s decision not to indict that officer.</p><p class="">Of course <a href="https://www.al.com/reckon/2023/11/why-hbcu-students-are-stepping-up-pro-palestine-activism-on-campuses-and-beyond.html" target="_blank">HBCU students</a>, who believe it is important to face injustice head on, would be organizing pro-Palestinian marches. In fact, doing so\xa0aligns with what HBCU students, myself included, have been taught: You don’t just need to find a career, as the late Howard University graduate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIHZypMyQ2s" target="_blank">Chadwick Boseman</a> said during his commencement speech there in 2018; you should find a purpose, one that transcends a paycheck.</p><p class="">If that purpose includes fighting for social justice — as it should and as so many HBCU students and alumni pride themselves on — then why would Morehouse students stay quiet when their school’s administration\xa0invites Biden to step into their sacred space and deliver a commencement speech right now?</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">Why would Morehouse students stay quiet when their school’s administration invites Biden to step into their sacred space and deliver a commencement speech right now?</p></div><p class="">Ziora Ajeroh, a student at North Carolina A&amp;T who started the school’s first chapter of Dissenters, an anti-war youth organization, told <a href="https://www.al.com/reckon/2023/11/why-hbcu-students-are-stepping-up-pro-palestine-activism-on-campuses-and-beyond.html" target="_blank">Reckon</a>, “As Black people, we aren’t new to violence. We’ve experienced violence our whole lives and for generations. So when other people are experiencing violence, we feel it’s our duty to stand in solidarity with them and not because they have also stood in solidarity with us, but because it’s the right thing to do.”</p><p class="">There are Dissenters chapters on other HBCU campuses, including Hampton University and Xavier University of Louisiana, demanding that their college presidents issue statements calling for a permanent cease-fire in Gaza. Thus far, no HBCU has risen to that challenge, but with a tradition that includes training activists to change the literal course of history, I am hopeful that Morehouse and other colleges will heed that call.</p><p class="endmark">While the aggrieved Morehouse students, faculty and alumni have not made such a public demand — the goal is that the invitation to Biden be rescinded —\xa0may the president respond to their discontent by standing up for innocent people in Gaza and refusing to fund the bombs that are killing them.</p></div></div></body></html>', 'https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/morehouse-biden-commencement-protest-rcna149382'}

Rudick had been following up on a monthslong email trail of requests seeking the participation of Howard’s boss, <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/chris-jansing-reports/watch/david-pecker-admits-catch-and-kill-scheme-was-to-help-trump-in-2016-election-209705541754" target="_blank">AMI CEO David Pecker</a>, for a feature-length documentary on the origin, evolution and impact of his most infamous publication. The meeting was brief, and as Rudick would recall to our team afterward, centered on a single question: “How much of the film will be focused on Donald Trump?” (In true Enquirer<em> </em>fashion, readers will be “shocked” to learn that AMI declined all requests to have any of its staff participate in the film, in order to “protect” the “confidential investigative reporting process of our journalists and editors.”)</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">Why would Trump care about the editorial stratagems of a trashy supermarket tabloid in the first place? </p></div><p class="">At the time of that reply, our team had already spent months researching the outlet,\xa0interviewing two former Enquirer editors-in chief, a former Los Angeles bureau chief, a former senior photo editor, and over a dozen former editors and reporters, all of whom willingly and in great detail shared many specific practices and tactics of their former employer’s “reporting process.”</p><p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"></p><p class="">Those processes were put under a microscope this past week as part of the alluring reality show unfolding in a lower Manhattan courtroom, the <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-hush-money-trial-delay-new-york-rcna147540" target="_blank">People of the State of New York v. Donald Trump</a>.

But putting aside why <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/chris-jansing-reports/watch/stormy-daniels-is-most-important-person-jury-will-hear-from-in-hush-money-trial-209016901763" target="_blank">Stormy Daniels might need to be paid hush money</a>, why would Trump care about the editorial stratagems of a trashy supermarket tabloid in the first place? This was a magazine whose arguably biggest claim had been scoring the<a href="https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/elvis-in-the-box-the-national-enquirer-issue-that-" target="_blank"> only photo of a dead Elvis lying in his coffin</a>, which sold millions of papers in 1977.</p><p class="">Trump and the AMI CEO were indeed symbiotic bedfellows. But before there was David Pecker, there was Generoso Pope Jr.</p><p class=""><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2002/06/wolcott-tabloid-journalism" target="_blank">Pope fashioned the National Enquirer back</a> in the late 1950s as a gore rag featuring block headlines that barked “news” items like “MAN DRILLS HOLE IN HIS HEAD FOR KICKS,” with full-page, blood-soaked photos designed to grab attention and drive newsstand sales. But by the late 1960s, those newsstands were gone, and Pope did a full editorial makeover on his paper so he could sell it in the one place where he knew millions of Americans go: the supermarket. By the early 1970s, Pope had brokered deals to place racks he had designed at the front end of checkout lines in thousands of grocery stores across America, effectively guaranteeing that the covers of his tabloid<em> </em>would be seen by millions of “enquiring minds” every week.</p><p class="">Pope’s former employees told us that his real genius was a keen understanding of the mind of the typical Enquirer reader, a fictional archetype he called “Missy Smith from Kansas City.” Pope and his editorial team closely monitored which stories drove the most sales, and ascertained that Missy Smith preferred a perfect blend of celebrity gossip, health tips, UFO encounters, predictions, human interest stories, and photos of adorable puppies.<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-enquirers-untold-story/" target="_blank"> Iain Calder, who worked for the Enquirer</a> from 1964 to 2000, largely as editor-in-chief, put it this way in our film: “We were Missy Smith in Kansas City, we were Missy Smith in Yonkers. We were Missy Smith in California. We were Missy Smith everywhere.”</p><p class="">This is relevant to why David Pecker and Donald Trump are sitting in the same lower Manhattan courtroom last week. When Pecker took charge of the Enquirer’s parent company, AMI, in 1999, he inherited that precious, eye-level, front-of-the-checkout-line real estate that Pope had secured years earlier. Pecker also inherited a tradition of having a vast spy network of unconventional, paid sources across Hollywood, Manhattan, Vegas, D.C., London, Monte Carlo and points beyond, whom his reporters would rely on for salacious information about celebrities and politicians.</p><p class="">According to several former Enquirer<em> </em>employees we talked to for our film, one of the best sources for gossip that the paper had in the 1990s, long before he was a political candidate, was Donald Trump. And a reporter named Larry Haley was assigned to be the full-time “Trump editor.” As Haley pointed out in our documentary, “Trump was a New York guy that the Enquirer wanted salacious stories from, because they sold a lot of papers.” And, Haley says, “Trump saw the National Enquirer as a megaphone to an audience that he did not have.”</p><p class="">Pecker also had a pattern of aligning himself with powerful politicians on the rise, regardless of party affiliation. This is the man who, in 1995, as president of a division of Hachette Filipacchi,<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2056d7c1-5695-4a7c-a398-d0568209b7d6" target="_blank"> cozied up to John F. Kennedy Jr. to announce the launch of George,</a> a celebrity-driven glossy magazine with a “fresh, non-partisan” perspective. This is also the man who in 2002, as CEO of AMI, would acquire Weider Publications, publisher of the nation’s most widely read muscle and fitness magazines. Pecker would forge a valuable alliance with<a href="https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article24466252.html" target="_blank"> Weider’s most prominent board member, Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> and<a href="https://lamag.com/news/the-hush-hush-deal-that-made-arnold-schwarzenegger-governor" target="_blank"> enthusiastically back him in a successful 2003 bid</a> to become the Republican governor of California.</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">Unless you stared at the ceiling or down at your feet it was impossible to miss the perfectly placed Enquirer cover in its new role as political advertisement.</p></div><p class="">Standing in grocery checkout lines in the months leading up to the 2016 election, I often felt like I was in a scene from “The Manchurian Candidate.” Unless you stared at the ceiling or down at your feet it was impossible to miss the perfectly placed Enquirer cover in its new role as political advertisement. One week Hillary Clinton was “IN JAIL!” A trip for milk would reveal she had “SIX MONTHS TO LIVE!” with a photo of her on death’s door. Other weeks the covers were bright, with headlines as big and bold as the ones about the guy who drilled a hole in his head. One standout issue promised to tell me and everyone else in line that day all about “THE DONALD TRUMP NOBODY KNOWS!”</p><p class="endmark">We did not know at that time any of the details of the deal-making that had transpired between Trump and Pecker. We did not know then that information potentially damaging to the Trump campaign would be acquired by Enquirer staffers, doing what Enquirer staffers have done for years as de rigueur for the job, and buried so as never to reach the public. What we did discover was that Pecker had successfully test-driven his skill for catching and killing negative stories on powerful allies with political aspirations years before he and Trump would go into business together.

"The Republican candidate for president owes <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari/watch/busted-trump-ordered-to-pay-millions-in-civil-fraud-case-204387909725" target="_blank">half a billion in fines for bank fraud </a>and is currently spending his days farting himself awake during a <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-hush-money-trial-image-rcna149428" target="_blank">porn star hush money trial</a>, and the race is tied?"

Jost joked about her cover of Tom Petty\'s "<a href="https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/lara-trump-song-rnc-dnc-rcna145722" target="_blank">I Won\'t Back Down</a>," saying, "I can’t believe I’m saying this to a member of the Trump family, but maybe stick to politics."</p><p class="">Jost did inject some earnestness into his speech at the end, telling Biden that his late grandfather had voted for him "because you\'re a decent man."</p><p class="">Jost follows a long line of comedians who have roasted the president at the annual dinner. Not everyone has the stomach for it, though. Former President Donald Trump, who attended the dinner as a guest in 2011, was mocked so ruthlessly by then-President Barack Obama that it "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/13/us/politics/donald-trump-campaign.html?_r=0" target="_blank">accelerated his ferocious efforts to gain stature within the political world</a>," The New York Times reported in 2016.</p><p class="endmark">Trump never attended the event as president — the only president to do so <a href="https://www.c-span.org/white-house-correspondents-dinner-2024" target="_blank">since Calvin Coolidge</a> <strong>—</strong> though <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7oG74nHSTQ" target="_blank">he was</a> still <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDbx1uArVOM" target="_blank">brutally roasted</a> in absentia.</p></div></div></body></html>'}

{'Republicans’ efforts to impeach Biden are truly over', '<html><body><div><div class="article-body__content"><p class="">Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., no doubt hoped that House Republicans’ efforts to impeach President Joe Biden would end in a glorious victory. As chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, Comer has poured everything into his crusade to take Biden down, with no witness too sketchy to rely on, no theory too preposterous to consider, and no allegation too absurd to shout. In the end, he and his compatriots were sure, the full horror of the president’s misdeeds would be exposed, the public would recoil in disgust and Republicans would get a Biden scandal to balance the mountain of scandals around the Trump administration. Even if a conviction in the Senate was out of reach, it would be impossible for a humiliated Biden to be re-elected.</p><p class="">Things have not worked out the way Comer and his colleagues wished.\xa0The only ones humiliated were the bush-league Javerts of the GOP. CNN has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/24/politics/house-gop-biden-impeachment-effort/index.html" target="_blank">reported</a> that “Comer recently approached one of his Republican colleagues and made a blunt admission: He was ready to be ‘done with’ the impeachment inquiry into Biden.” And Republicans — and their media allies — are hoping you forget all about it.</p><p class="">The Oversight Committee has long been a key forum for the opposition to bedevil the president; it can issue subpoenas, hold hearings and release reports, all in service of its mission to keep tabs on the government. Instead of stocking the committee with the caucus’ best and brightest, former Speaker Kevin McCarthy <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/subcommittee/full-committee/" target="_blank">granted committee seats</a> to the House GOP’s most ridiculous blowhards, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Green, Lauren Boebert and Paul Gosar.</p><p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"></p><p class="">At the first official impeachment hearing last September, the Republicans’ own star expert witness <a href="https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1707454645721764125" target="_blank">admitted</a> that there was no evidence Biden had committed impeachable crimes. One Republican aide <a href="https://twitter.com/MZanona/status/1707434463674671558" target="_blank">called the hearing</a> “an unmitigated disaster.” And it got no better from there.</p><p class="">In between hearings, Comer and other members would go on TV and toss out words like “bribery” and “money laundering.” They alleged that various interests directed millions of dollars into the president’s pocket, without ever being able to back up their claims. “This is one of the biggest crimes that I’ve ever studied, with respect to American history,”<a href="https://twitter.com/therecount/status/1683941042133803009" target="_blank"> said Comer</a>. The exact details were less clear: “We know [the Biden family] got tens of millions of dollars from bad people in bad countries. We don’t know what exactly they did,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/14/biden-impeachment-inquiry-comer-evidence/" target="_blank">Comer explained</a> at one point. But that just proved what a masterful criminal Biden was.</p><p class="">Again and again, they’d find some new piece of information, rush to the cameras to proclaim that they had located the smoking gun, then watch as their claims collapsed when the mundane truth came out. The president’s brother James Biden gave his brother $200,000 in 2018, Comer breathlessly revealed. Surely there was something fishy going on! But <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/31/politics/fact-check-evidence-supports-democrats-case-that-joe-biden-made-a-personal-loan-to-his-brother/index.html" target="_blank">it turned out</a> to be the repayment of a loan the future president gave James two months before. The fact that the check had “loan repayment” written on it might have been a clue.</p><p class="">As the months wore on, the investigation grew more farcical. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/now-indicted-fbi-informant-was-heart-gops-case-joe-biden-rcna139200" target="_blank">One key witness</a> whom Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, had touted as a “highly credible confidential human source” turned out to be under indictment for lying to the FBI and falsifying records, and <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/republicans-scramble-save-biden-impeachment-informant-1234972867/" target="_blank">may have been</a> working with Russian intelligence. Each hearing was <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/comer-keeps-stepping-impeachment-witness-204817287.html" target="_blank">more absurd</a> than the last, with witnesses shredding the case against Biden and Democrats mocking their Republican colleagues mercilessly.</p><div class="liftout liftout--small" data-testid="liftout"><p class="liftout__text">The fruitless quest to find something criminal Biden did is particularly ironic given that Republicans are working so hard to return Trump to the White House. </p></div><p class="">The Republican case has always revolved around the president’s pitiable son Hunter, whose struggles with addiction and sometimes dissolute lifestyle are well known. In between displaying his <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/news/watch-house-democrat-brutally-torches-marjorie-taylor-greenes-shameful-display-of-hunter-bidens-dck-pics/" target="_blank">nude selfies</a>, Republicans professed outrage that Hunter traded on his family name — a timeless habit of the well-connected that never aroused Republicans’ ire when, say, Donald Trump’s family did it. Their obsession with Hunter was so intense that even when the president’s son was indicted on tax and gun charges by the Justice Department, Comer <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/hunter-biden-indictment-coverup-james-comer-rcna128862" target="_blank">spun it</a> as a cover-up.</p><p class="">But as the serial pratfalls of the committee continued, Comer and others realized this was a lost cause. So has the conservative media: In 2023 there were <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/study-how-sean-hannity-helped-build-gops-collapsing-hunter-biden-impeachment-case#paragraph--section-heading--3457280" target="_blank">an astonishing 325 segments</a> about Hunter Biden on Sean Hannity’s program alone. Once it became clear that impeachment was fizzling out, Fox News <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/sean-hannity-hasnt-mentioned-gop-impeachment-probe-fox-over-month" target="_blank">stopped talking</a> about the subject.</p><p class="">That silence only drives home that these hearings weren’t designed to root out corruption, but to score political points. You might recall that Trump was first impeached for pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to open a sham investigation of Biden in order to discredit him ahead of the 2020 election. Comer and House Republicans delivered what Zelenskyy refused to.</p><p class="">And yet, despite the best efforts of the House GOP’s worst people, the investigation did not find any corruption. That’s not to say Biden is a paragon of ethical purity; he’s done a few questionable things, like <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/apr/22/joe-biden/fact-checking-joe-biden-being-full-professor-four-/" target="_blank">taking a position</a> at the University of Pennsylvania after his vice presidency that involved a healthy salary and few responsibilities. That kind of sweetheart deal may be a little unseemly, but it’s neither illegal nor particularly uncommon for someone in his position.</p><p class="endmark">Corruption, however, is something very different — and there’s never been any credible evidence that Biden is corrupt at all. The fruitless quest to find something criminal Biden did is particularly ironic given that Republicans are working so hard to return possibly the most corrupt president in history to the White House. Even now, they support him as he argues to the Supreme Court that presidents must be immune from prosecution for any crimes they might commit while in office. So if they want to find corruption, they know where they can look.</p></div></div></body></html>', 'https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/republicans-biden-impeachment-fox-news-rcna149386'}

The justices interrogated lawyers on both sides, leaving legal experts to try to read the tea leaves. Will they embrace any of team Trump’s legal theories? We won’t hear the final decision until late June or early July. With so much at stake, we asked Supreme Court expert <strong>Neal Katyal </strong>for his insights into potential outcomes and how the ruling may affect the timeline of <strong>Jack Smith’s</strong> case.</p><p class=""><em>Trump’s lawyers are arguing that the president is effectively immune from things like directing a military coup. What do you make of their view of the presidency?</em></p><p class="">I think Trump’s lawyer was so bombastic in making these claims that it skewed a lot of the media coverage. Justice <strong>Sonia Sotomayor</strong> early in the argument gave him a chance to walk back these extravagant arguments (like that the president could order Navy SEAL Team 6 to go assassinate his political rival), and the lawyer did not. While that may have been where Justices <strong>Brett Kavanaugh </strong>and <strong>Samuel Alito</strong> were, it was pointedly not where it seemed like others on the court (and in particular Justices <strong>Sotomayor</strong>, <strong>Elena Kagan,</strong> <strong>Ketanji Brown Jackson</strong>, but also <strong>Amy Coney Barrett) </strong>were. This will likely come down to the chief justice and what he wants to do in terms of the court’s role in all of this.</p><p class=""><em>Obviously SCOTUS thinks there’s at least some merit to Trump’s argument, otherwise they would not have taken up this appeal. What surprised you most about Thursday’s hearing?</em></p><p class="">I’ve seen over 400 oral arguments at the Supreme Court, and have personally argued 51 cases there. Most of the time, I can walk out of the courtroom with a good sense of what the justices are going to do. This was not one of those times. I don’t think either attorney walked out feeling like a clear winner today — and that’s both a real surprise and a real concern. I still don’t think the court is even remotely prepared to embrace the idea of absolute immunity put forth by Trump. But they might give him <em>something</em> — and that’s a big problem in my mind. If you give Trump an inch, he’ll take a mile, and this is a case where they shouldn’t give him anything at all.</p><hr class=""><h2 class=""><strong>A story you should be following: Tennessee\'s push to arm teachers</strong></h2><p class="">On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/tennessee-republicans-agree-let-teachers-carry-guns-schools-rcna149145" target="_blank">Tennessee House Republicans passed a bill</a> allowing teachers and other school staff to be armed in public schools. This comes a little over a year after <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/nashville-shooting-covenant-school-gun-laws-rcna76878" target="_blank">a lone shooter killed three children and three adults</a> at a private school in Nashville, the state’s deadliest mass shooting ever.</p><p class="">As legislators passed the bill in a 68-28 vote, protesters in the chamber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk3lrxyMZFU" target="_blank">chanted</a> “blood on your hands.”</p><p class="">Gov. <strong>Bill Lee</strong> is expected to sign the bill, which would allow staff members to carry a concealed handgun after obtaining an enhanced carry permit, permission from school administrators and law enforcement, 40 hours of training, a background check and a psychological exam.</p><p class="">The bill also includes a confidentiality clause, meaning that parents and students would not be notified about which teachers are carrying guns — a bizarre element that Republican lawmakers claim is essential to “the element of surprise.”</p><p class="">Clearly, the tragedy last year, and the activism of parents and legislators, has not changed the trajectory of gun access in Tennessee.
